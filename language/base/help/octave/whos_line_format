@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {@var{val} =} whos_line_format ()
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {@var{old_val} =} whos_line_format (@var{new_val})
Query or set the format string used by the @code{whos}.

The following escape sequences may be used in the format:
@table @code
@item %b
Prints number of bytes occupied by variables.
@item %c
Prints class names of variables.
@item %e
Prints elements held by variables.
@item %n
Prints variable names.
@item %p
Prints protection attributtes of variables.
@item %s
Prints dimensions of variables.
@item %t
Prints type names of variables.
@end table

Every command may also have a modifier:
@table @code
@item l
Left alignment.
@item r
Right alignment (this is the default).
@item c
Centered (may only be applied to command %s).
@end table

A command is composed like this:
%[modifier]<command>[:size_of_parameter[:center-specific[:print_dims[:balance]]]];

Command and modifier is already explained. Size_of_parameter
tells how many columns the parameter will need for printing.
print_dims tells how many dimensions to print. If number of
dimensions exceeds print_dims, dimensions will be printed like
x-D.
center-specific and print_dims may only be applied to command
%s. A negative value for print_dims will cause Octave to print all
dimensions whatsoever.
balance specifies the offset for printing of the dimensions string.

The default format is "  %p:4; %ln:6; %cs:16:6:8:1;  %rb:12;  %lc:-1;\n".
