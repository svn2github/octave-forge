Produce Nyquist plots of a system; if no output arguments are given, Nyquist
plot is printed to the screen.

Compute the frequency response of a system.

@strong{Inputs} (pass as empty to get default values)
@table @var
@item sys
system data structure (must be either purely continuous or discrete;
see @code{is_digital})
@item w
frequency values for evaluation.
If sys is continuous, then bode evaluates @math{G(@var{jw})}; 
if sys is discrete, then bode evaluates @math{G(exp(@var{jwT}))},
where @var{T} is the system sampling time.
@item default
the default frequency range is selected as follows: (These
steps are @strong{not} performed if @var{w} is specified)
@enumerate
@item via routine @command{__bodquist__}, isolate all poles and zeros away from
@var{w}=0 (@var{jw}=0 or @math{exp(@var{jwT})=1}) and select the frequency
range based on the breakpoint locations of the frequencies.
@item if @var{sys} is discrete time, the frequency range is limited
to @var{jwT} in

@item A ``smoothing'' routine is used to ensure that the plot phase does
not change excessively from point to point and that singular
points (e.g., crossovers from +/- 180) are accurately shown.
@end enumerate
@item   atol
for interactive nyquist plots: atol is a change-in-slope tolerance
for the of asymptotes (default = 0; 1e-2 is a good choice).  This allows
the user to ``zoom in'' on portions of the Nyquist plot too small to be
seen with large asymptotes.
@end table
@strong{Outputs}
@table @var
@item    realp
@itemx   imagp
the real and imaginary parts of the frequency response
@math{G(jw)} or @math{G(exp(jwT))} at the selected frequency values.
@item w
the vector of frequency values used
@end table

If no output arguments are given, nyquist plots the results to the screen.
If @var{atol} != 0 and asymptotes are detected then the user is asked
interactively if they wish to zoom in (remove asymptotes)
Descriptive labels are automatically placed.

Note: if the requested plot is for an @acronym{MIMO} system, a warning message is
presented; the returned information is of the magnitude
