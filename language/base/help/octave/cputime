@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{total}, @var{user}, @var{system}] =} cputime ();
Return the CPU time used by your Octave session.  The first output is
the total time spent executing your process and is equal to the sum of
second and third outputs, which are the number of CPU seconds spent
executing in user mode and the number of CPU seconds spent executing in
system mode, respectively.  If your system does not have a way to report
CPU time usage, @code{cputime} returns 0 for each of its output values.
Note that because Octave used some CPU time to start, it is reasonable
to check to see if @code{cputime} works by checking to see if the total
CPU time used is nonzero.
