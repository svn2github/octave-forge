%TRANSFORMEDGE Transform an edge with an affine transform
%
%   EDGE2 = transformEdge(EDGE1, TRANS);
%   where EDGE1 has the form [x1 y1 x2 y1], and TRANS is a transformation
%   matrix, return the edge transformed with affine transform TRANS. 
%
%   Format of TRANS can be one of :
%   [a b]   ,   [a b c] , or [a b c]
%   [d e]       [d e f]      [d e f]
%                            [0 0 1]
%
%   EDGE2 = transformEdge(EDGES, TRANS); 
%   Also wotk when EDGES is a [N*4] array of double. In this case, EDGE2
%   has the same size as EDGE.
