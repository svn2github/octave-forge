@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {@var{val} =} debug_on_interrupt ()
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {@var{old_val} =} debug_on_interrupt (@var{new_val})
Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave will try
to enter debugging mode when it receives an interrupt signal (typically
generated with @kbd{C-c}).  If a second interrupt signal is received
before reaching the debugging mode, a normal interrupt will occur.
