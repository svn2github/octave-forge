@deftypefn {Function File} {} path (@dots{})
Modify or display Octave's @code{LOADPATH}.

If @var{nargin} and @var{nargout} are zero, display the elements of
Octave's @code{LOADPATH} in an easy to read format.

If @var{nargin} is zero and nargout is greater than zero, return the
current value of @code{LOADPATH}.

If @var{nargin} is greater than zero, concatenate the arguments,
separating them with @code{pathsep()}.  Set the internal search path
to the result and return it.

No checks are made for duplicate elements.
