@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{ret}] =} odeplot (@var{t}, @var{y}, @var{flag})

Open a new figure window and plot the results from the variable @var{y} of type column vector over time while solving. The types and the values of the input parameter @var{t} and the output parameter @var{ret} depend on the input value @var{flag} that is of type string. If @var{flag} is
@table @option
@item  @code{"init"}
then @var{t} must be a double column vector of length 2 with the first and the last time step and nothing is returned from this function,
@item  @code{""}
then @var{t} must be a double scalar specifying the actual time step and the return value is true (resp. value 1),
@item  @code{"done"}
then @var{t} must be a double scalar specifying the last time step and nothing is returned from this function.
@end table

This function is called by a OdePkg solver function if it was specified in an OdePkg options structure with the @command{odeset}. This function is an OdePkg internal helper function therefore it should never be necessary that this function is called directly by a user. There is only little error detection implemented in this function file to achieve the highest performance.

Run examples with the command
@example
demo odeplot
@end example
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{ret}] =} odeprint (@var{t}, @var{y}, @var{flag})

Display the results of the set of differential equations in the Octave window while solving. The first column of the screen output shows the actual time stamp that is given with the input arguemtn @var{t}, the following columns show the results from the function evaluation that are given by the column vector @var{y}. The types and the values of the input parameter @var{t} and the output parameter @var{ret} depend on the input value @var{flag} that is of type string. If @var{flag} is
@table @option

This function file can be used to solve a set of non--stiff ordinary differential equations (non--stiff ODEs) and non-stiff differential algebraic equations (non-stiff DAEs). This function file is a wrapper to @file{odepkg_mexsolver_rodas.c} that uses Hairer's and Wanner's Fortran solver @file{rodas.f}.

If this function is called with no return argument then plot the solution over time in a figure window while solving the set of ODEs that are defined in a function and specified by the function handle @var{@@fun}. The second input argument @var{slot} is a double vector that defines the time slot, @var{init} is a double vector that defines the initial values of the states, @var{opt} can optionally be a structure array that keeps the options created with the command @command{odeset} and @var{par1}, @var{par2}, @dots{} can optionally be other input arguments of any type that have to be passed to the function defined by @var{@@fun}.

If this function is called with one return argument then return the solution @var{sol} of type structure array after solving the set of ODEs. The solution @var{sol} has the fields @var{x} of type double column vector for the steps chosen by the solver, @var{y} of type double column vector for the solutions at each time step of @var{x}, @var{solver} of type string for the solver name and optionally the extended time stamp information @var{xe}, the extended solution information @var{ye} and the extended index information @var{ie} all of type double column vector that keep the informations of the event function if an event function handle is set in the option argument @var{opt}.

If this function is called with more than one return argument then return the time stamps @var{t}, the solution values @var{y} and optionally the extended time stamp information @var{xe}, the extended solution information @var{ye} and the extended index information @var{ie} all of type double column vector.

@deftypefnx {Command}  {[@var{odestruct}] =} odeset (@var{oldstruct}, @var{newstruct})

If this function is called without an input argument then return a new OdePkg options structure array that contains all the necessary fields and sets the values of all fields to default values.

If this function is called with string input arguments @var{"field1"}, @var{"field2"}, @dots{} identifying valid OdePkg options then return a new OdePkg options structure with all necessary fields and set the values of the fields @var{"field1"}, @var{"field2"}, @dots{} to the values @var{value1}, @var{value2}, @dots{}

If this function is called with a first input argument @var{oldstruct} of type structure array then overwrite all values of the options @var{"field1"}, @var{"field2"}, @dots{} of the structure @var{oldstruct} with new values @var{value1}, @var{value2}, @dots{} and return the modified structure array.

If this function is called with two input argumnets @var{oldstruct} and @var{newstruct} of type structure array then overwrite all values in the fields from the structure @var{oldstruct} with new values of the fields from the structure @var{newstruct}. Empty values of @var{newstruct} will not overwrite values in @var{oldstruct}.

For a detailed explanation about valid fields and field values in an OdePkg structure aaray have a look at the @file{odepkg.pdf}, Section 'ODE/DAE/IDE options' or run the command @command{doc odepkg} to open the tutorial.
