__HEADER__(`Developer's Notes')

<h2>Contributing Code to the Gnu Octave Repository</h2>


<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
To contribute your .m files, C++, C, or Fortran code to the GNU Octave
Repository (octave-forge) you need to
<ul>
    <li> have an account on SourceForge,
    <li> be registered as an octave-forge developer,
    <li> have <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>
        installed on the computer from which you
        will submit contributions, and
    <li> have the secure shell,
         <a href="http://www.openssh.com/"><tt>ssh</tt></a>, installed
         on your computer.
</ul>
The first two requirements are easy but may take a few days.  
If you don't already have one, request a SourceForge (SF) account
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php"> here</a>.
To register as a developer send a request 
to the octave-forge mailing list 
<a href="mailto:octave-dev@lists.sf.net">octave-dev@lists.sf.net</a>.
Include a bit of information about the code
you plan to submit. 
Finally, if your computer runs linux or
FreeBSD, chances are good that both <tt>ssh</tt> and CVS are already 
installed on your system. 
If they aren't, 
you will need to find prebuilt packages for them or download their
source codes and build them.

<h3>Create a SF home directory</h3>
<p>
If you've never submitted code to a SourceForge project before,
create your home directory by
logging onto the octave-forge account with <tt>ssh</tt>:
<pre>
   $ ssh -l <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>sflogin</i></FONT>  octave.cvs.sourceforge.net
   Password:  <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>your SF password</i></FONT>
</pre>
Although SF will only show you a message-of-the-day screen then log
you out, this process has the useful side effect of creating a home
directory for you if one doesn't already exist.  Some CVS commands will fail
if you do not have a home directory on SF.

<h3>Download the latest octave-forge distribution</h3>
CVS expects the 
code you plan to submit to reside in a directory within the existing
octave-forge directory structure.
You will therefore need to download a copy of the latest octave-forge
distribution to work in.  Change directories to a place you want
to put the code, then issue the CVS <i>checkout</i>
(abreviated as 'co') command:
<pre>
   $ cd <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>working_directory</i></FONT>
   $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
   $ cvs -d:ext:<FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>sflogin</i></FONT>@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/octave co octave-forge
</pre>

<h3>Where does your code belong?</h3>

Put your file(s) in a subdirectory under the <tt>octave-forge/</tt>
directory.  Here are some guidelines to help you decide where your
code belongs:
<ul>
	<li> <b><tt>admin/</tt></b><br>
	Contains files and scripts used to administer the octave-forge
	website and build the release files.  Nothing in here is needed
	by octave-forge users.

	<li> <b><tt>doc/</tt></b><br>
	Documentation for octave in general.  Documentation for specific
	packages goes into the <tt>doc/</tt> subdirectory of the individual package 
	directories.  There are no standards for documentation at this
	time.

	<li> <b><tt>extra/</tt></b><br>
	Packages which:
	<ul>     <li> are too narrow in scope for <tt>main/</tt>, or
	    <li> act as alternatives for functions in <tt>main/</tt>, or
	    <li> do not follow octave conventions (because they want
	     to retain compatibility with matlab for example), or
	    <li> are primarily developed elsewhere, or
	    <li> require patches to Octave, or
	    <li> are designed for older versions of Octave, or
	    <li> haven't been tested enough.
</ul>
	<li> <b><tt>extra/patches/</tt></b><br>
	Small patches to Octave. Patches should be labelled as
	name-version.patch, with version being the Octave version 
	number on which the patch was based.  The start of the 
	patch file should contain a description of what it does.  
	Patches should be generated with diff -c or diff -cp.

	<li> <b><tt>main/</tt></b><br>
	Packages which may eventually be included in the main octave 
	distribution.  As such, they should follow Octave conventions.  
	The octave-forge CVS tree should be the primary development/release 
	site.  All functions should work with the latest Octave 
	interpreter without any special compilation switches or patches
	applied.

	<li> <b><tt>nonfree/</tt></b><br>
	Packages which are not freely modifiable and redistributable 
	with modifications, or which depend on code which is not 
	free.  This includes functions which only permit non-commercial 
	use and functions which must be kept together as a package.  
	Functions in all other directories must be freely redistributable 
	with modifications.  Functions in non-free must be freely 
	redistributable for non-commercial use.  Functions of unknown
	license should not be included anywhere, since no license implies
	default license implies no rights to redistribute.

</ul>

<h3>Package structure</h3>
<dl>
<dt>package/NOINSTALL
<dd>	don't install this package; the user can rename or delete this
	file if they want the package installed anyway.
<dt>package/*.m 
<dd>	m-files for the package; these will be installed in
	site/mfiles/octave-forge/package
<dt>package/data/*
<dd>	datafiles to be installed with the mfiles.  You can accesses
	them from your m-files with x = file_in_load_path("a").
<dt>package/Makefile 
<dd>	Makefile with a default target to build anything that needs
	building, an optional "install" target in case you need to
	install something other than m-files, oct-files, data files or
	octave binaries, and a "clean" target to remove everything that
	has been built.  See below for details.
<dt>package/configure.add, package/Makeconf.add
<dd>	Additional configuration-time commands to run in order to 
	find all the components that your package requires.  You 
	can look for anything you want in configure.add and note 
	what you need in Makeconf.add.  The definitions in 
	Makeconf.add will be available when you include ../../Makeconf 
	in your Makefile.  See main/symbolic for an example.
<dt>package/*.oct
<dd>	oct-files built by Makefile. These will be installed all 
	together in site-oct-files/octave-forge.  You may assume that
	HAVE_OCTAVE_20 is defined for 2.0.x series mkoctfile, and
	HAVE_OCTAVE_21 is defined for 2.1.x series mkoctfile.
<dt>package/bin/*
<dd>	executable files built by Makefile.  These will be 
	installed in Octave's EXEC_PATH, so they will be available 
	from Octave but not from the shell. You have two options
	regarding this directory.  The better one would be to make
	sure that the directory exists before you try building the
	binary.  The other option is to have a hidden bin/.keepdir
	so that CVS won't delete it for you automatically.
</dl>

<h3>Adding a Makefile</h3>

If your package has something other than m-files you will need a 
Makefile in your directory.  This could be as short as three lines:
<pre>
include ../../Makeconf
all: f1.oct
clean: ; -$(RM) *.o core octave-core *.oct *~
</pre><p>

If you define multiple DEFUN_DLD's in a file, you may need to
use symbolic links in order for Octave to find them:
<pre>
include ../../Makeconf

# extra functions defined in fn.oct
fn_LINKS=fn2.oct fn3.oct

# all compiled functions
PROGS=fn.oct $(fn_LINKS) gn.oct

all: $(PROGS)

$(PROGS): Makefile

$(fn_LINKS):
	-$(RM) $@
	$(LN_S) fn.oct $@

clean: ; -$(RM) *.o core octave-core *.oct *~
</pre><p>

The "include ../../Makeconf" line above includes all of the definitions 
that were created during configuration.  This includes things like MKOCTFILE,
as well as implicit rules for compiling oct-files.  See Makeconf.base 
for a list of predefined variables and rules.  Sometimes you will see
"sinclude ../../Makeconf".  This is for packages which can be compiled
independently of Octave-forge.  If Octave-forge is configured, then the
variable OCTAVE_FORGE will be defined.<p>

Even more complicated makefiles are sometimes necessary, particularly when
the package depends on external libraries.  See main/symbolic/Makefile
for an example.  The external libraries must be found during configure
so main/symbolic/configure.add provides detection rules.  The results 
are posted in main/symbolic/Makeconf.add, and will be available during make.<p>

Please try to keep compatibility with older versions of Octave.  The main
configure script tests for features that have changed since octave-2.1.36.
The tests are done in such a way that conditions are only defined if you
are using an older version of octave.  That way if the tests are not performed
and the conditions are not defined, support defaults to the newer version
of octave.  The following conditions are defined in configure.base:
<dl>
<dt>HAVE_SLLIST_H
<dd>subsref changed from using SLList to using std::list.
To support older versions of octave, use:<pre>
#ifdef HAVE_SLLIST_H
#define LIST SLList
#define LISTSIZE length
#define SUBSREF_STRREF
#else
#include &lt;list&gt;
#define LIST std::list
#define LISTSIZE size
#define SUBSREF_STRREF &amp;
#endif
...
  octave_value subsref (const std::string SUBSREF_STRREF type,
                        const LIST&lt;octave_value_list&gt;&amp; idx) {
	...
  }
  octave_value_list subsref (const std::string SUBSREF_STRREF type,
                             const LIST&lt;octave_value_list&gt;&amp; idx,
                             int nargout) {
        ...

     if (idx.LISTSIZE () > 1)
        ...
  }
</pre>
<dt>NEED_OCTAVE_QUIT
<dd>signal handling changed from longjump to C++ exceptions. To support 
older versions of octave, use:<pre>
#ifdef NEED_OCTAVE_QUIT
#define OCTAVE_QUIT do {} while (0)
#define BEGIN_INTERRUPT_IMMEDIATELY_IN_FOREIGN_CODE
#define END_INTERRUPT_IMMEDIATELY_IN_FOREIGN_CODE
#define octave_throw_bad_alloc() \
   do { jump_to_top_level(); panic_impossible(); } while (0)
#else
#include &lt;octave/quit.h&gt;
#endif
</pre>
<dt>USE_OCTAVE_NAN
<dd>octave_NaN and octave_Inf constants were converted to functions.  
To support older versions of octave, use:<pre>
#ifdef USE_OCTAVE_NAN
#define lo_ieee_nan_value() octave_NaN
#define lo_ieee_inf_value() octave_Inf
#endif
</pre>
</dl>
<p>m-file support across multiple versions
is tricky.  Sometimes try/catch will help, but for syntax
changes you will need some sort of preprocessor, such as
awk or sed.
</p>

<h3>Submit your code!</h3>
You are now ready to upload your code to the Gnu Octave Repository.
Do this with two CVS commands--one to add a new
entry for your file in the octave-forge catalog, and a second command
to actually upload the file:
<pre>
   $ cvs add <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>files</i></FONT>
   $ cvs commit <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>files</i></FONT>
</pre>

After hitting the carriage return at the end of the commit command,
CVS will open your default editor so that you can enter comments about
the commit. The first time you commit a file the comment might be
something as simple as `Initial commit into CVS.' However, for all
subsequent commits please add meaningful comments that explain why
changes were made to the file since all comments will appear in the
changelog.  Try to gather related changes into one commit command.
<p>
Aside:  the default editor can be defined like so:
<pre>
   $ export EDITOR=<FONT COLOR="#800000">vim</FONT>
</pre>
<p>

If you are uploading an entire package, then put your directory into the
octave-forge tree and do the following:
<pre>
   $ cd octave-forge/main
   $ cvs add <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>package</i></FONT>
   $ cvs commit <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>package</i></FONT>
   $ cd <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>package</i></FONT>
   $ cvs add *
   $ cvs commit *
</pre>

You may find it easier to use the import command, especially if your
package contains subdirectories.  In this case, you should not put
your directory into the octave-forge tree.  Instead, change to the
root of your package tree and enter the following:
<pre>
   $ cd <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>package</i></FONT>
   $ cvs -d:ext:<FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>sflogin</i></FONT>@octave.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/octave import -m "<FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>package name</i></FONT>" octave-forge/<FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>main/package</i></FONT> <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>sflogin</i></FONT> start
</pre>

You can then fetch the new package from octave-forge as follows:
<pre>
   $ cd octave-forge
   $ cvs -q update -d
</pre>

<p>
From time to time, you will need to synchronize with CVS:
<pre>
   $ cd octave-forge
   $ cvs -q update -d
</pre>
Each file will be listed with one of the following codes:
<ul>
<li> `?' for files you created didn't add and commit.
<li> `M' for files you modified but didn't commit.
<li> `C' for files which have unresolvable conflicts.  Look inside the file to
see what it was that couldn't be resolved.  It will be clearly marked, or you
can do a cvs diff on the file to highlight the conflict.
<li> `U' for files you haven't touched but are modified on the server.
<li> `P' for files you have modified in a way consistent with the modifications
on the server (?), e.g., because you submitted a patch for someone else to apply.
</ul>

<h3>Learn more about CVS</h3>
The few CVS commands shown here just scratch the surface of this
powerful versioning package.  If you become an active contributor
you will benefit from learning more CVS commands and understanding 
how CVS works.
The
<a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html">
CVS Book</a> is a great place to begin your exploration.

<h3>Join the developers' mailing list</h3>
Finally, consider joining the octave-forge developer's 
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/octave-dev">
mailing list</a>.  It is very low traffic.  It is used to announce
pending releases of octave-forge and discuss issues related to
working with octave-forge.  Discussion of the functions in
octave-forge mostly occurs on the primary octave mailing lists.
