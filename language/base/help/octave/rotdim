@deftypefn {Function File} {} rotdim (@var{x}, @var{n}, @var{plane})
Return a copy of @var{x} with the elements rotated counterclockwise in
90-degree increments.  The second argument is optional, and specifies
how many 90-degree rotations are to be applied (the default value is 1).
The third argument is also optional and defines the plane of the
rotation. As such @var{plane} is a two element vector containing two
different valid dimensions of the matrix. If @var{plane} is not given
Then the first two non-singleton dimensions are used.

Negative values of @var{n} rotate the matrix in a clockwise direction.
For example,

@example
@group
rotdim ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1, [1, 2])
@result{}  3  1
         4  2
@end group
@end example

@noindent
rotates the given matrix clockwise by 90 degrees.  The following are all
equivalent statements:

@example
@group
rotdim ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1, [1, 2])
rotdim ([1, 2; 3, 4], 3, [1, 2])
rotdim ([1, 2; 3, 4], 7, [1, 2])
@end group
