\section{min\_max}
\subsubsection{Short description}
Ranges of matrix rows.\\

\subsubsection{Matlab}
It is almost the same name as in Matlab. The difference is the underscore in the function name. Octave seems to have a problem otherwise. That means the function name \textit{minmax} throw an error.

\subsubsection{Test description}
The test file is called \textit{min\_max\_test.m} \textcolor{red}{localized at ...}\\
Some different tests must be done:\\
1. no input: this should cause an error\\
2. too much inputs, at least 2: this should also cause an error\\
3. too much return values defined in the function call: I don't know, what happens...\\
4. Input matrix with only one row, if neural network does have only one input neuron\\
5. Input matrix with more than only one row\\
6. Input matrix as cell array\\
7. Reacts \textit{min\_max} as the same as Matlabs \textit{minmax}?\\
