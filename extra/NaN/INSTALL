
Installing the NaN-tb with Octave:
----------------------------------
a) You need repmat.m (e.g. from P.Kienzle's MATCOMPAT) 
    If you havenot installed it yet, you should do it now. 

b) extract files from NaNnnn.tar.gz and move them into 
.../octave/.../m/statistics/base/ 

c) Alternatively, the files can be moved into any other directory; but you 
must remove from .../octave/.../m/statistics/base/ 
mean.m, meansq.m, median.m, moment.m, skewness.m, kurtosis.m, std.m, var.m
and from .../source_forge/.../statistics/*
zscore.m, mad.m, geomean.m, harmmean.m 

d) (re-)start Octave and run NANTEST. 
This checks whether all previous functions have been replaced


Installing the NaN-tb for Matlab:
----------------------------------
Ensure that the NaN-directory is first in your path. This should override any 
alternative function definition (except built-in's) with the same name. 

(re-)start Matlab or clear functions and run NANTEST. 
This checks whether all previous functions have been replaced
