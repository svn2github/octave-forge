@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {[@var{v}, @var{ier}, @var{nfun}, @var{err}] =} quad (@var{f}, @var{a}, @var{b}, @var{tol}, @var{sing})
Integrate a nonlinear function of one variable using Quadpack.
The first argument is the name of the  function, the function handle or
the inline function to call to compute the value of the integrand.  It
must have the form

@example
y = f (x)
@end example

@noindent
where @var{y} and @var{x} are scalars.

The second and third arguments are limits of integration.  Either or
both may be infinite.

The optional argument @var{tol} is a vector that specifies the desired
accuracy of the result.  The first element of the vector is the desired
absolute tolerance, and the second element is the desired relative
tolerance.  To choose a relative test only, set the absolute
tolerance to zero.  To choose an absolute test only, set the relative
tolerance to zero. 

The optional argument @var{sing} is a vector of values at which the
integrand is known to be singular.

The result of the integration is returned in @var{v} and @var{ier}
contains an integer error code (0 indicates a successful integration).
The value of @var{nfun} indicates how many function evaluations were
required, and @var{err} contains an estimate of the error in the
solution.

You can use the function @code{quad_options} to set optional
parameters for @code{quad}.
