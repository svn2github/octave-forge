@deftypefn {Function File} {} poly (@var{a})
If @var{a} is a square @math{N}-by-@math{N} matrix, @code{poly (@var{a})}
is the row vector of the coefficients of @code{det (z * eye (N) - a)},
the characteristic polynomial of @var{a}.  As an example we can use
this to find the eigenvalues of @var{a} as the roots of @code{poly (@var{a})}.
@example
roots(poly(eye(3)))
@result{} 1.00000 + 0.00000i
@result{} 1.00000 - 0.00000i
@result{} 1.00000 + 0.00000i
@end example
In real-life examples you should, however, use the @code{eig} function
for computing eigenvalues.

If @var{x} is a vector, @code{poly (@var{x})} is a vector of coefficients
of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of @var{x}.  That is,
of @var{c} is a polynomial, then the elements of 
@code{@var{d} = roots (poly (@var{c}))} are contained in @var{c}.
The vectors @var{c} and @var{d} are, however, not equal due to sorting
and numerical errors.
