Packages
========
* Graceplot and GPC package needs conversion to package manager

Bugs
====
* ausave -> auload changes the data

Admin
=====

* Include support for more tests in the makefile.

* Maintain global TODO document by automatically extracting ## TODO:
comments from all of the scripts.  Update all functions to include
compatibility notes (aka missing features) in these comments.  Some
function specific notes in matcompat/compat.dat belong in TODO comments.

* nonfree/gpc uses its own configure script and build process

* consider -enable/disable on a package by package basis as a way
to override the NOINSTALL files on some of the directories; maybe
just an -enable-all option?

All functions
=============

* Use texinfo in the function descriptions.

* Add test and demo scripts for each function.  Should we use
extra/testfun, or should we use name_test.m and name_demo.m?
	
* Replace x(find(cond)) with x(cond) since it is faster and cleaner.
Remove unwind_protect blocks for do_fortran_indexing, since most
instances will be covered by this.

* Replace max(max(x)) with max(x(:)), and so on for min, sum, etc.

Specific functions
==================

* Use newer version of QHull.

* merge plot/dhbar with Octave's bar; add preference variable for 'filled';
add control for bar width

* Give ginput a "number of inputs" parameter.  Redefine gtext as an
m-file which calls ginput(1) to get the text location.

* Give ginput a rubber-banding facility, maybe with number of inputs =
-1 ?  Redefine gzoom as an m-file which calls ginput(-1) to get the
region.

* Have ginput return the key/mouse button used to exit.
