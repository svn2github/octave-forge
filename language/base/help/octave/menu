@deftypefn {Function File} {} menu (@var{title}, @var{opt1}, @dots{})
Print a title string followed by a series of options.  Each option will
be printed along with a number.  The return value is the number of the
option selected by the user.  This function is useful for interactive
programs.  There is no limit to the number of options that may be passed
in, but it may be confusing to present more than will fit easily on one
screen.
