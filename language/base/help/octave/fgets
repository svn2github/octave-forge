@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} fgets (@var{fid}, @var{len})
Read characters from a file, stopping after a newline, or EOF,
or @var{len} characters have been read.  The characters read, including
the possible trailing newline, are returned as a string.

If @var{len} is omitted, @code{fgets} reads until the next newline
character.

If there are no more characters to read, @code{fgets} returns @minus{}1.
