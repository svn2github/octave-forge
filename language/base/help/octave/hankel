@deftypefn {Function File} {} hankel (@var{c}, @var{r})
Return the Hankel matrix constructed given the first column @var{c}, and
(optionally) the last row @var{r}.  If the last element of @var{c} is
not the same as the first element of @var{r}, the last element of
@var{c} is used.  If the second argument is omitted, it is assumed to
be a vector of zeros with the same size as @var{c}.

A Hankel matrix formed from an m-vector @var{c}, and an n-vector
@var{r}, has the elements
