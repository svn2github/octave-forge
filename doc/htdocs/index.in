   Octave-Forge is a central location for the collaborative
   development of packages for <a href="http://www.octave.org">GNU Octave</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Octave-forge packages contains the source for all the functions and are
    designed to work with the Octave package system. In general the packages are
    designed to work with the latest development version of Octave, but it should
    be possible to use most packages with earlier versions.

    <h2 class="flash">Installing packages</h2>
    <p>
      You can find the list of packages by clicking on the <em>Packages</em> link at the top.
      To install a package, download the package file, and install it from the Octave prompt
      by typing
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
      pkg install package_file_name.tar.gz
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      where <em>package_file_name.tar.gz</em> is the name of the file you downloaded.
    </p>

    If you have code to contribute, send a message to the
    <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/octave-dev">repository mailing list</a>
    or <a href="developers.html">join the development team</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For convenience Octave-Forge supplies pre-built installers for Octave:
    <ul>
    <li><b><a href="__WINDOWS__">Windows installer</a> (Octave and Octave-Forge)</b>
    <li><b><a href="__OSX__">Octave.app for Mac OS X</a></b> Octave.app is a ready to run binary version of GNU Octave. It runs on most of Apple's Mac OS X computers and comes with all the free libraries that are needed. The application can also be expanded by downloading and installing further packages as described before.
    </ul>
