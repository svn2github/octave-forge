##
## OPTIONS
##  --author    This is the name and e-mail address of the author, and the
##              year(s). Defaults to name obtained from getpwnam call (no guess
##              for e-mail address) and current year. Can be specified multiple
##              times.
##
##  --comment   Character to use as comment. Defaults to '##' and '//' for
##              Octave and C++ source. See '--files' option.
##
##  --files     Extension of files to edit. Defaults to 'm'. Can also be 'cc'
##              and 'h'. See also the '--comment' option.
##
##  --license   License to use. Defaults to "GPL". Valid options are "GPL",
##              "LGPL", "AGPL", "modified BSD", "FreeBSD", "simplified BSD" and
##              "public domain".
##
##  --replace   Replace existing copyright notice on the files for the new one.
##              A copyright notice is identified as the first block of comments
##              as per the '--comment' option.
##
##  --verbose   Turns verbosity on.
##
##
## EXAMPLES:
##   Basic usage. Add a copyright notice to all .m files under current directory, recursively.
##      copyright_fix .
##
##   Same as before but with year and path specified
##      copyright_fix --author="Carnë Draug <carandraug+dev@gmail.com>=2009-2011"/home/devel/pkg/
##
##    Same as before but use '%%' for comment
##      copyright_fix --author="Carnë Draug <carandraug+dev@gmail.com>=2009-2011" --comment="%%" /home/devel/pkg/
##
##    Basic usage but for .cc files
##      copyright_fix --files="cc" .
##
##   Specifying mutiple authors with different years
##      copyright_fix --author="Carnë Draug <carandraug+dev@gmail.com>=2011" --author="Juan Carbajal <carbajal@ifi.uzh.ch>=2010" --comment="%%".
##
##   Specifying license
##      copyright_fix --license="modified BSD" .
