Tested against octave-2.1.69.  Many functions will also work on 
earlier versions of Octave.  The usual build instructions apply:

  ./configure; make; make check; make install
  
Note that some tests will fail because of known bugs or missing
features.  This should be indicated in the tests themselves.  Many
tests will fail on older versions of Octave.

*** WARNING *** if installing in a user directory, octave may crash
immediately on startup.  Either install into a system directory, or
remove the comm/PKG_ADD and sparse/PKG_ADD from the install directory
(octave-2.1.49 on RedHat 7.3 exhibits this problem).
