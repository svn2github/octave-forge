@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} ifft (@var{a}, @var{n}, @var{dim})
Compute the inverse FFT of @var{a} using subroutines from
@sc{Fftw}. The inverse FFT is calculated along the first non-singleton dimension
of the array. Thus if @var{a} is a matrix, @code{fft (@var{a})} computes
the inverse FFT for each column of @var{a}.

If called with two arguments, @var{n} is expected to be an integer
specifying the number of elements of @var{a} to use, or an empty
matrix to specify that its value should be ignored. If @var{n} is
larger than the dimension along which the inverse FFT is calculated, then
@var{a} is resized and padded with zeros. Otherwise, if@var{n} is
smaller than the dimension along which the inverse FFT is calculated,
then @var{a} is truncated.

If called with three arguments, @var{dim} is an integer specifying the
dimension of the matrix along which the inverse FFT is performed
