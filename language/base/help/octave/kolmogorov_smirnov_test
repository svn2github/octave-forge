@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{ks}] =} kolmogorov_smirnov_test (@var{x}, @var{dist}, @var{params}, @var{alt})
Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the null hypothesis that the
sample @var{x} comes from the (continuous) distribution dist. I.e.,
if F and G are the CDFs corresponding to the sample and dist,
respectively, then the null is that F == G.

The optional argument @var{params} contains a list of parameters of
@var{dist}.  For example, to test whether a sample @var{x} comes from
a uniform distribution on [2,4], use

@example
kolmogorov_smirnov_test(x, "uniform", 2, 4)
@end example

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative F
!= G.  In this case, the test statistic @var{ks} follows a two-sided
Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
one-sided alternative F > G is considered.  Similarly for @code{"<"},
the one-sided alternative F > G is considered.  In this case, the
test statistic @var{ks} has a one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov
distribution.  The default is the two-sided case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.
