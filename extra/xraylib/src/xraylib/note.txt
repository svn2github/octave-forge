Version 2.4  (srio@esrf.fr, 2006/1/12)

Updates from previous version (2.3):

- The installation script (install.sh) asks for the installation root
  directory (default = $HOME)

- A bug related to swig versions 1.3.12 and later is fixed:
     at the bottom of the src/make_python.sh the line 
        -o ../bin/xraymodule.so 
     is replaced by:
        -o ../bin/_xraylib.so 
     ( the important thing is the underscore, as described in
     http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html#Python_nn6)

     NOTE that this change is not back compatible with lower versions of swig. 

     To avoid conflicts, the installation script install.sh has been 
     modified and it asks for running or not locally swig during
     installation. The default answer is NO. In this case pre-created
     src/xraylib_wrap.c and bin/xraylib.py will be used. The user should only 
     use swig if the version is 1.3.12 and later.

Version 2.2

Major updates from previous version (2.1):

- Partial lines included

Fixed bugs and updates from previous version (2.1):

- ShellName expanded in xrayglob.c, SHELLNUM increased to 28 in xrayglob.h

- Shell names #define placed in file shells.h

- Line names #define placed in file lines.h

- fluor_lines.dat updated by file with partial lines

- radrate.dat updated by file with partial lines

- Fluorescence Energy converted from eV to KeV (/1000)

- xraylib.i modified

- KA_LINE, KB_LINE, LA_LINE and LB_LINE are now calculated in terms of
  partial lines in fluor_lines.c and radrates.c

- shells.pro and lines.pro defines the lines and shells names for IDL
