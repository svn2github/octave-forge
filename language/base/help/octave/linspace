@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} linspace (@var{base}, @var{limit}, @var{n})
Return a row vector with @var{n} linearly spaced elements between
@var{base} and @var{limit}.  The number of elements, @var{n}, must be
greater than 1.  The @var{base} and @var{limit} are always included in
the range.  If @var{base} is greater than @var{limit}, the elements are
stored in decreasing order.  If the number of points is not specified, a
value of 100 is used.

The @code{linspace} function always returns a row vector.
