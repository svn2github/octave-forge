@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{y}, @var{x}] =} lsim (@var{sys}, @var{u}, @var{t}, @var{x0})
Produce output for a linear simulation of a system; produces 
a plot for the output of the system, @var{sys}.

@var{u} is an array that contains the system's inputs.  Each row in @var{u}
corresponds to a different time step.  Each column in @var{u} corresponds to a
different input.  @var{t} is an array that contains the time index of the
system; @var{t} should be regularly spaced.  If initial conditions are required
on the system, the @var{x0} vector should be added to the argument list.

When the lsim function is invoked a plot is not displayed; 
however, the data is returned in @var{y} (system output)
and @var{x} (system states).
