@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} eval (@var{try}, @var{catch})
Parse the string @var{try} and evaluate it as if it were an Octave
program.  If that fails, evaluate the string @var{catch}.
The string @var{try} is evaluated in the current context,
so any results remain available after @code{eval} returns.
@end deftypefn
