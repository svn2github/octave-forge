<body><h1>Octave Compatibility FAQ</h1>

<p>This document is out of date.  Please see the 
<a href="http://wiki.octave.org/wiki.pl?MatlabOctaveCompatibility">Compatibility page</a> on the <a href="http://wiki.octave.org">Octave wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Octave is mostly compatible with Matlab.  Most matlab functions can
be made to run with very little change.  With careful coding, you can 
get your code to run without change in Matlab and Octave.  This document 
outlines the things that you need to watch out for.</p>

<p>You may want to start Octave with the option --traditional, which sets
a number flags so that the interpreter handles things in a more
compatible way.  See the "porting" section of the octave FAQ:
	http://www.octave.org/FAQ.html#SEC24
<p>
Be sure you have a recent development version of octave and install
<a href="http://octave.sf.net">octave-forge</a>.</p>

<h2>Language Elements</h2>
<ul>

<li>Q. Do load and save work for structures?
<br>A. Versions of octave after 2.1.53 support loading and saving of
   structures in all of its file formats.
   
<li>Q. Does octave support 'end' indexing?
<br>A. Yes, for sufficiently new versions of octave.  For older versions,
   use length(A) or size(A,1) and size(A,2) as you did before matlab
   added the 'end' indexing syntax.

<li>Q. Why do "grid on" and other commands give me a syntax error?
<br>A. Only Octave built-ins can be ``text functions'' (and only a few
   are defined to be).  Those which are not built-in, you can mark
   as text functions using the following line in your ~/.octaverc:
	mark_as_command grid axis
   Either that or use the functional form: grid('on')

<li>Q. Why isn't Octave seeing my .matlabrc file?
<br>A. Because it is not called .octaverc.

<li>Q. How do I compile my mex functions?
<br>A. See the mex subdirectory of octave-forge/extras.   

<li>Q. debugging?
<br>A. it exists but is not well documented
<table>
<tr><td>  dbstop if error            <td>-> <td>debug_on_error = 1
<tr><td>   dbstop in mfile at lineno  <td>-> <td>dbstop (func, line)
<tr><td>   dbclear in mfile at lineno <td>-> <td>dbclear (func, line)
<tr><td>   dbquit    <td>-> <td>quit
<tr><td>   dbstack   <td>-> <td>dbwhere
<tr><td>   dbcont    <td>-> <td>dbg_cont
<tr><td>   dbstep in <td>-> <td>dbg_step
<tr><td>   dbstep    <td>-> <td>dbg_next
<tr><td>   dbstatus  <td>-> <td>dbstatus
</table>

<li>Q. assignin
<br>A. Get a recent version of octave.

<li>Q. [a{:}] = ...
<br>A. Octave can not yet use this construct to define multiple output
   arguments. Use "[a{1},a{2}] =" instead. It is expected that this will be
   fixed in a future release.

</ul>
<h2>Types</h2>
<ul>

<li>Q. Does Octave support sparse matrices?
<br>A. Use sparse package in octave-forge.

<li>Q. Does Octave support nD arrays?
<br>A. Yes, for sufficiently recent versions of octave

<li>Q. Does octave support cell arrays?
<br>A. Yes, in recent development versions.

<li>Q. Does octave support different precisions char, short, float, etc?
<br>A. Use 2.1.58 when it is released

<li>Q. Does octave support symbolic variables?
<br>A. Use symbolic package in octave-forge.  There is no support for symbolic
   matrices.  Symbolic equivalents to builtin functions use uppercase first
   letter since Octave can overload built-in functions for user-defined 
   types (see Sparse answer above for alternative).

<li>Q. Does octave support arrays of structures?
<br>A. Yes in recent development versions.

</ul>
<h2>Toolboxes</h2>
<ul>

<li>Q. simulink
<br>A. Doesn't exist.  Search for simulink in the 
<a href="http://www.octave.org/octave-lists/archive/index.html">octave archives</a>
for suggested alternatives.

<li>Q. Is there an optimization tool box?
<br>A. Use octave-forge.  This is incomplete.  If you need more see
   Joao's summary of the octave lists.

<li>Q. ODE's?
<br>A. Octave has lsode.  octave-forge has matlab style ode23, etc.

<li>Q. Integration?
<br>A. Octave has quad. octave-forge has matlab V5 style quadrature functions.
   quadl was recently added to octave-forge.

<li>Q. Are there matlab style UI functions?
<br>A. No. some work on Tcl/Tk links to Octave, but it is incomplete.  There
   are two separate branches.  See octave archives and octave-forge. 

<li>Q. Signal processing package?
<br>A. octave-forge has many functions.  Others are available:

<dl>
<dt>	vco, modulate, demod
<dd>	Time Frequency Toolbox
<br>	http://www-isis.enst.fr/Applications/tftb/iutsn.univ-nantes.fr/auger/tftb.html

<dt>	arcov, armcov, prony, pmusic
<dd>	SPC Tools spline directory
<br>	ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/tools/spctools/

</dl>

<li>Q. Statistics toolbox
<br>A. many of the functions exist but often under different names in base octave

<li>Q. Control systems toolbox
<br>A. many of the functions exist but often under different names in base octave

</ul>
<h2>Individual functions</h2>
<ul>

<li>Q. Where do I find the matlab function XXX?
<br>A. Many XXX are in the octave-forge package at http://octave.sf.net.  This
   is a collection of Octave functions contributed by the user community
   but not (yet) included in Octave.  If it is not there, then you can
   try Joao Cardoso's summary of the octave mailing lists at
	http://merlin.inescn.pt/~qual/Octave/Octave_links.html
   or search the Octave mailing list archives directly at
	http://www.octave.org/octave-lists/archive/index.html
   You can also search the matlab contributions site and the wider net for 
   alternatives to existing matlab functions.

<li>Q. Why is the title of my graph not showing up on my graph.
<br>A. Octave wants the title before the plot command, matlab
   wants it after.  Try setting automatic_replot = 1

<li>Q. logm doesn't work well for ill-conditioned matrices.
<br>A. logm is a stalled work in progress.  Ask pkienzle@users.sf.net 
   to post the work he and Ross Lippert did on this.

<li>Q. eig(A,B)
<br>A. qz(A,B)

<li>Q. Can parameters be passed through the call to fsolve() to the
    user-supplied function?
<br>A. use FIXES/fsolve.cc on octave-forge.

<li>Q. inmem
<br>A. who -functions

<li>Q. computer
<br>A. exists in octave, but probably returns different output

<li>Q. ! shell command
<br>A. system("shell command")

<li>Q. gallery, compan, hadamard
<br>A. http://www.ma.man.ac.uk/~higham/testmat.html

<li>Q. subspace
<br>A. http://www.mathworks.com/support/ftp/linalgv5.shtml

<li>Q. audio functions
<br>A. octave-forge/main/audio

<li>Q. datetick
<br>A. gset xdata time; gset timefmt "%d/%m"; gset format x "%b %d"

</ul>
