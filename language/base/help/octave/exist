@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} exist (@var{name}, @var{type})
Return 1 if the name exists as a variable, 2 if the name (after
appending @samp{.m}) is a function file in Octave's @code{path}, 3 if the
name is a @samp{.oct} or @samp{.mex} file in Octave's @code{path},
5 if the name is a built-in function, 7 if the name is a directory, or 103
if the name is a function not associated with a file (entered on
the command line).

Otherwise, return 0.

This function also returns 2 if a regular file called @var{name}
exists in Octave's search path.  If you want information about
other types of files, you should use some combination of the functions
@code{file_in_path} and @code{stat} instead.

If the optional argument @var{type} is supplied, check only for
symbols of the specified type.  Valid types are

@table @samp
@item "var"
Check only for variables.
@item "builtin"
Check only for built-in functions.
@item "file"
Check only for files.
@item "dir"
Check only for directories.
@end table
@end deftypefn
