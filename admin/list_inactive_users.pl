## This perl script tries to list all the inactive users of the project,
## considering inactive users who haven't made a commit since a specific date.
##
## It first gets the list of users with access to the repository by parsing a
## HTML page from sourceforge where they are listed (parses the page correctly
## on 2011-04-19). As such, this script requires internet connection.
##
## Note: actually it places all users on a hash table to make it faster
##
## Second it runs svn for the specified repository (path must be supplied) and
## attempts to parse the logs between the HEAD of the repository and a specified
## date. The users found on these logs are removed from the list (their key is
## removed from the hash table).
##
## Finally, the list of keys is sorted and printed to STDOUT
