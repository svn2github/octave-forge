@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{p}, @var{s}] =} polyfit (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{n})
Return the coefficients of a polynomial @var{p}(@var{x}) of degree
@var{n} that minimizes
@iftex
@tex
$$
\sum_{i=1}^N (p(x_i) - y_i)^2
$$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@code{sumsq (p(x(i)) - y(i))},
@end ifinfo
 to best fit the data in the least squares sense.

The polynomial coefficients are returned in a row vector.

If two output arguments are requested, the second is a structure
containing the following fields:

@table @code
@item R
The Cholesky factor of the Vandermonde matrix used to compute the
polynomial coefficients.
@item X
The Vandermonde matrix used to compute the polynomial coefficients.
@item df
The degrees of freedom.
@item normr
The norm of the residuals.
@item yf
The values of the polynomial for each value of @var{x}.
@end table
@end deftypefn
