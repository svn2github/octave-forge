@defvr {Built-in Variable} warn_reload_forces_clear
If several functions have been loaded from the same file, Octave must
clear all the functions before any one of them can be reloaded.  If
@code{warn_reload_forces_clear}, Octave will warn you when this happens,
and print a list of the additional functions that it is forced to clear.
@end defvr
