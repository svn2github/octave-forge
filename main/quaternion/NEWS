Summary of important user-visible changes for releases of the quaternion package

===============================================================================
quaternion-2.0.1   Release Date: 2012-xx-yy   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

** inv
   Support for the inversion of quaternion matrices.  Right and left division
   operators (/ and \) profit from this change and support quaternion matrices
   as well.

** Check number of arguments when operators are called by their function names,
   e.g. plus (q1, q2, q3).  Function plus supports now more than two arguments.

** doc/quaternion.pdf
   Revised PDF manual.  There is now a function index at the end of the manual.


===============================================================================
quaternion-2.0.0   Release Date: 2012-03-28   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

** First official release.  Its main features are:
   -- Matrices and n-dimensional arrays of quaternions.
   -- Overloaded operators due to the use of classes.
   -- Operator semantics similar to Octaveâ€™s built-in complex numbers.
   -- Vectorized code for crunching large quaternion arrays in a speedy manner.
