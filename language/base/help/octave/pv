Returns the present value of an investment that will pay off @var{p} for @var{n}
consecutive periods, assuming an interest @var{r}.

The optional argument @var{l} may be used to specify an additional
lump-sum payment made at the end of @var{n} periods.

The optional argument @var{method} may be used to specify whether
payments are made at the end (@code{"e"}, default) or at the

Note that the rate @var{r} is specified as a fraction (i.e., 0.05,
not 5 percent).
