To use mex, first compile the mex.cc support library.

a.) If you are using the octaveSF package, then you won't
    need to do anything---it was compiled and installed when you
    compiled and installed octaveSF and you can skip the remaining
    instructions.

b.) If you are using mex with octave 2.0.x, edit the Makefile and
    replace 'mkoctfile' with 'mkoctfile -DHAVE_OCTAVE_20'.

c.) Type make to build mex.o and mex

d.) Move mex to your executable path (e.g., ~/bin) and mex.1 to your
    man path and you are done
