@deftypefn {Function File} {} cor (@var{x}, @var{y})
Compute correlation.

The (@var{i}, @var{j})-th entry of @code{cor (@var{x}, @var{y})} is
the correlation between the @var{i}-th variable in @var{x} and the
@var{j}-th variable in @var{y}.

@iftex
@tex
$$
{\rm corrcoef}(x,y) = {{\rm cov}(x,y) \over {\rm std}(x) {\rm std}(y)}
$$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@example
corrcoef(x,y) = cov(x,y)/(std(x)*std(y))
@end example
@end ifnottex

For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a variable;
vectors are always observations and may be row or column vectors.

@code{cor (@var{x})} is equivalent to @code{cor (@var{x}, @var{x})}.

Note that the @code{corrcoef} function does the same as @code{cor}.
