function o=meansq(i,DIM)
% MEANSQ calculates the mean of the squares
%
% y = meansq(x,DIM)
%
% DIM	dimension
%	1 STD of columns
%	2 STD of rows
% 	N STD of  N-th dimension 
%	default or []: first DIMENSION, with more than 1 element
%
% features:
% - can deal with NaN's (missing values)
% - dimension argument also in Octave
% - compatible to Matlab and Octave
%
% see also: SUMSQ, SUMSKIPNAN, MEAN, VAR, STD, RMS
