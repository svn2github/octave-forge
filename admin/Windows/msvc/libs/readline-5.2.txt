Requirement: cc-msvc

   original sources

     --prefix=/whatever/you/want

3) make shared

   Import lib files are not installed, so copy manually readline.lib and
   history.lib into lib directory. The command "make install-shared" also
   installs the DLL into the lib directory, so move them into your bin
   directory.
