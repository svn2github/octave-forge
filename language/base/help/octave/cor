@deftypefn {Function File} {} cor (@var{x}, @var{y})
The (@var{i}, @var{j})-th entry of @code{cor (@var{x}, @var{y})} is
the correlation between the @var{i}-th variable in @var{x} and the
@var{j}-th variable in @var{y}.

For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a variable;
vectors are always observations and may be row or column vectors.

@code{cor (@var{x})} is equivalent to @code{cor (@var{x}, @var{x})}.
