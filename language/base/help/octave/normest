@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{n}, @var{c}] =} normest (@var{a}, @var{tol})
Estimate the 2-norm of the matrix @var{a} using a power series
analysis. This is typically used for large matrices, where the cost
of calculating the @code{norm (@var{a})} is prohibitive and an approximation
to the 2-norm is acceptable.

@var{tol} is the tolerance to which the 2-norm is calculated. By default
@var{tol} is 1e-6. @var{c} returns the number of iterations needed for
@code{normest} to converge.
