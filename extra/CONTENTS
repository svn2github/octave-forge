Packages which:
   * are too narrow in scope for main, or
   * act as alternatives for functions in main, or
   * do not follow octave conventions (because they want
     to retain compatibility with matlab for example), or
   * are primarily developed elsewhere, or
   * require patches to Octave, or
   * are designed for older versions of Octave, or
   * haven't been tested enough.
