@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{x}, @var{p}, @var{n}, @var{k}, @var{d}] =} unmkpp (@var{pp})

Extract the components of a piece-wise polynomial structure @var{pp}.
These are as follows:

@table @asis
@item @var{x}
Samples points.
@item @var{p}
Polynomial coefficients for points in sample interval. @code{@var{p}
(@var{i}, :)} contains the coefficients for the polynomial over
interval @var{i} ordered from highest to lowest. If @code{@var{d} >
1}, @code{@var{p} (@var{r}, @var{i}, :)} contains the coefficients for 
the r-th polynomial defined on interval @var{i}. However, this is 
stored as a 2-D array such that @code{@var{c} = reshape (@var{p} (:,
@var{j}), @var{n}, @var{d})} gives @code{@var{c} (@var{i},  @var{r})}
is the j-th coefficient of the r-th polynomial over the i-th interval.
@item @var{n}
Number of polynomial pieces.
@item @var{k}
Order of the polynomial plus 1.
@item @var{d}
Number of polynomials defined for each interval.
