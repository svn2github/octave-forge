@defvr {Built-in Variable} warn_associativity_change
If the value of this variable is nonzero, Octave will warn about
possible changes in the meaning of some code due to changes in
associativity for some operators.  Associativity changes have typically
been made for Matlab compatibility.  The default value is 1.
