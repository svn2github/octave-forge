This package has been built against the @OCTAVE_VERSION@ version of Octave. 
It has been built using revision @BUILD_REVISION@ of the building scripts 
hosted at http://octave.sourceforge.net.

This version of Octave has many new features relative to previous versions, 
including

* integer types
* fixed point arithmetic
* sparse matrices
* Linear programming code based on GLPK
* 64-bit compilation support
* gzipped files and stream and consequently support of Matlab v7 files
* Matlab compatiable graphic handles
* better support for both msvc and mingw
* fully compatiable MEX interface
* many many other minor features and compatibility changes

Using this package for the development of OCT and MEX files:
-----------------------------------------------------------

This package is bundled with the compiler used to compile this package.
This version of the package has been compiled with TDM's port of GCC/mingw32
using GCC version @GCC_VERSION@.
The compiler is available from

http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc/

OCT files can be compiled from the Octave prompt with the "mkoctfile"
command, whereas as MEX files can be compiled with the "mex" command.

Contributing to Octave:
----------------------

There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make Octave
a better system. Perhaps the most important way to contribute is to
write high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make your
code freely available for others to use. For inspiration, we have a
wish-list of projects (http://www.octave.org/projects.html) and
feature requests.

If you've written a useful function for Octave that you would like to
make available for others to use, please post it to the sources
mailing list (sources@octave.org). Messages sent to this list will be
seen by the Octave maintainers, and will be considered for inclusion
in future releases of Octave. The messages are also archived
(http://www.octave.org/archive.org) , so even if the code is not
included in a future release, it will remain available for others to
use.

If you find Octave useful, consider providing additional funding
(http://www.octave.org/funding.html) to continue its development. Even
a modest amount of additional funding could make a significant
difference in the amount of time that its author can devote to
development and support.

If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still help
make Octave better and more reliable by reporting any bugs
(http://www.octave.org/bugs.html) you find and by offering suggestions
for ways to improve Octave.

Octave-Forge Packages
---------------------

This package is also bundled with a minimum MSYS environment required for
octave's package manager. Provided that the dependencies are met, octave-forge
packages can be installed from the octave prompt with the "pkg" command.

This package is bundled with the binaries & development files of external
libraries allowing the build of the following octave-forge packages:
