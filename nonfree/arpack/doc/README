LICENSE:
-------

Note that the ARPACK license includes the clause

<quote>
Written notification is provided to the developers of intent to use this 
software. Also, we ask that use of ARPACK is properly cited in any 
resulting publications or software documentation.
</quote>

This clause is difficult to interpret and so clarification has been
requested from the authors. Initial clarification can be found in the
e-mail Sorenson.eml. However, this is not considered to go far enough
to allow inclusion in Fedora. See the bug report

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=214967

for more information.

However, the e-mail does make it clear that there is no restrictions
on the distribution of this binding of ARPACK to Octave, and no
restrictions on its use. Furthermore, I take the clarification to mean
that modifications of these Octave bindings are allowed without
further notification to the authors. However, if ARPACK is to be used
with another package, even if it uses the octave code as a basis, then
further notification must be obtained.

DOWNLOAD:
--------

The main webpage for ARPACK is http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/
where two files can be obtained, these being

http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/SRC/arpack96.tar.gz
http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/SRC/patch.tar.gz

Note that the second file is not a patch, but rather another tar
archive that overwrites the existing files with replacements

Chao Yang maintains an updated version of ARPACK, and is one of the
authors of ARPACK. However, I'm unsure if this version has any
official status. It can be found at

http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~viral/parpack96/patch.tar.gz

PATCHES:
-------
Included here are a patch and a changelog file that were created
against the CVS of octave as of 22 Feb 2007. These might be used to
port this code to Octave once the above licensing question is
addressed. Note that the code eigs.cc, eigs-base.cc and svds.m must
also be copied to an appropriate place in the Octave source tree when
applying this patch
