Find the vectors normal to a meshgridded surface. The meshed gridded 
surface is defined by @var{x}, @var{y}, and @var{z}. If @var{x} and 
@var{y} are not defined, then it is assumed that they are given by

@example
[@var{x}, @var{y}] = meshgrid (1:size(@var{z}, 1), 
                     1:size(@var{z}, 2));
@end example

If no return arguments are requested, a surface plot with the normal 
vectors to the surface is plotted. Otherwise the componets of the normal
vectors at the mesh gridded points are returned in @var{nx}, @var{ny},
and @var{nz}.

The normal vectors are calculated by taking the cross product of the 
diagonals of eash of teh quadrilaterals in the meshgrid to find the 
normal vectors of the centers of these quadrilaterals. The four nearest
normal vectors to the meshgrid points are then averaged to obtain the 
normal to the surface at the meshgridded points.

An example of the use of @code{surfnorm} is

@example
surfnorm (peaks (25));
