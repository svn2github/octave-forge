@cindex Cholesky factorization
Compute the Cholesky factor, @var{r}, of the symmetric positive definite
sparse matrix @var{a}, where
@iftex
@tex
$ R^T R = A $.
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo

@example
r' * r = a.
@end example
@end ifinfo

If called with 2 or more outputs @var{p} is the 0 when @var{r} is positive
definite and @var{p} is a positive integer otherwise.

If called with 3 outputs then a sparsity preserving row/column permutation
is applied to @var{a} prior to the factorization. That is @var{r}
is the factorization of @code{@var{a}(@var{q},@var{q})} such that
@iftex
@tex
$ R^T R = Q A Q^T$.
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo

@example
r' * r = q * a * q'.
@end example
@end ifinfo

Note that @code{splchol} factorizations is faster and use less memory.
