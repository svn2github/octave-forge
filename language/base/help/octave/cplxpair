@deftypefn {Function File} {} cplxpair (@var{z}, @var{tol}, @var{dim})
Sort the numbers @var{z} into complex conjugate pairs ordered by 
increasing real part.  With identical real parts, order by increasing
imaginary magnitude. Place the negative imaginary complex number
first within each pair. Place all the real numbers after all the 
complex pairs (those with @code{abs (imag (@var{z}) / @var{z}) < 
@var{tol})}, where the default value of @var{tol} is @code{100 * 
@var{eps}}.

By default the complex pairs are sorted along the first non-singleton
dimension of @var{z}. If @var{dim} is specified, then the complex
pairs are sorted along this dimension.

Signal an error if some complex numbers could not be paired. Requires
all complex numbers to be exact conjugates within tol, or signals an 
error. Note that there are no guarantees on the order of the returned
pairs with identical real parts but differing imaginary parts.

@example
cplxpair (exp(2i*pi*[0:4]'/5)) == exp(2i*pi*[3; 2; 4; 1; 0]/5)
@end example
