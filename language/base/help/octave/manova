@deftypefn {Function File} {} manova (@var{y}, @var{g})
Perform a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The
goal is to test whether the p-dimensional population means of data
taken from @var{k} different groups are all equal.  All data are
assumed drawn independently from p-dimensional normal distributions
with the same covariance matrix.

The data matrix is given by @var{y}.  As usual, rows are observations
and columns are variables.  The vector @var{g} specifies the
corresponding group labels (e.g., numbers from 1 to @var{k}).

The LR test statistic (Wilks' Lambda) and approximate p-values are
computed and displayed.
