   Octave-Forge is a central location for the collaborative
   development of packages for <a href="http://www.octave.org">GNU Octave</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Octave-forge packages contains the source for all the functions and are
    designed to work with the Octave package system. In general the packages are
    designed to work with the latest development version of Octave, but it should
    be possible to use most packages with earlier versions.

    <li><b><a href="__OSX__">Octave.app for Mac OS X</a></b> is a ready to run binary version of GNU Octave. It runs on most of Apple's Mac OS X computers and comes with all the free libraries that are needed. The application can also be expanded by downloading and installing further packages as described before.
