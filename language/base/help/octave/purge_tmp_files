@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} purge_tmp_files
Delete the temporary files created by the plotting commands.

Octave creates temporary data files for @code{gnuplot} and then sends
commands to @code{gnuplot} through a pipe.  Octave will delete the
temporary files on exit, but if you are doing a lot of plotting you may
want to clean up in the middle of a session.

A future version of Octave will eliminate the need to use temporary
files to hold the plot data.
