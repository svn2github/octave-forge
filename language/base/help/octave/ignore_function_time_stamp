@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {@var{old_val} =} ignore_function_time_stamp (@var{new_val})
Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave checks
the time stamp on files each time it looks up functions defined in
function files.  If the internal variable is set to @code{"system"},
Octave will not automatically recompile function files in subdirectories of
@file{@var{octave-home}/lib/@var{version}} if they have changed since
they were last compiled, but will recompile other function files in the
search path if they change.  If set to @code{"all"}, Octave will not
recompile any function files unless their definitions are removed with
@code{clear}.  If set to "none", Octave will always check time stamps
on files to determine whether functions defined in function files
need to recompiled.
