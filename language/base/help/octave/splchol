@cindex Cholesky factorization
Compute the Cholesky factor, @var{l}, of the symmetric positive definite
sparse matrix @var{a}, where
@iftex
@tex
$ L L^T = A $.
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo

@example
l * l' = a.
@end example
@end ifinfo

If called with 2 or more outputs @var{p} is the 0 when @var{l} is positive
definite and @var{l} is a positive integer otherwise.

If called with 3 outputs that a sparsity preserving row/column permutation
is applied to @var{a} prior to the factorization. That is @var{l}
is the factorization of @code{@var{a}(@var{q},@var{q})} such that
@iftex
@tex
$ L R^T = A (Q, Q)$.
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo

@example
r * r' = a (q, q).
@end example
@end ifinfo

Note that @code{splchol} factorizations is faster and use less memory
than @code{spchol}. @code{splchol(@var{a})} is equivalent to
@code{spchol(@var{a})'}.
