@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {[@var{fid}, @var{msg}] =} tmpfile ()
Return the file ID corresponding to a new temporary file with a unique
name.  The file is opened in binary read/write (@code{"w+b"}) mode.
The file will be deleted automatically when it is closed or when Octave
exits.

If successful, @var{fid} is a valid file ID and @var{msg} is an empty
string.  Otherwise, @var{fid} is -1 and @var{msg} contains a
system-dependent error message.
