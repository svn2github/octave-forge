The queueing toolbox ("queueing", in short) is a collection of GNU
Octave scripts for numerical evaluation of queueing network
models. Open, closed and mixed networks are supported, with single or
multiple classes of customers. The queueing toolbox also provides
functions for steady-state and transient analysis of Markov chains, as
well as fo single station queueing systems.

The Web page of the queueing toolbox is

The latest version can be downloaded from Octave-forge

http://octave.sourceforge.net/

This package requires GNU Octave; version 3.0.0 or later should work.
The package contains the following directories (note that some of
these are only available in the SVN repository, and are not included
in the tarball published on Octave-forge):

inst/        
        Contains the Octave m-scripts implementing all functions
        provided by the queueing toolbox.

doc/
        Contains the user documentation, which is automatically
        generated from the texinfo strings embedded in the m-scripts.

scripts/ 
        Contains some scripts used to extract documentation strings
        from the m-files. The scripts here have been taken almost
        verbatim from the GNU Octave distribution.

examples/
        Contains demo functions which are automatically extracted from
        the scripts included in the inst/ directory. The demo
        functions are put in this directory so that they can be
        embedded into the package documentation.

test/
        Contains the script used to execute all tests embedded within
        functions in the inst/ directory.

devel/
        Contains scripts which are currently under development, and
        therefore should not be used.

General Public License, version 3 or later. See the file COPYING for
