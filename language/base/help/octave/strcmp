@deftypefn {Function File} {} strcmp (@var{s1}, @var{s2})
Return 1 if the character strings @var{s1} and @var{s2} are the same,
and 0 otherwise.

If either @var{s1} or @var{s2} is a cell array of strings, then an array
of the same size is returned, containing the values described above for
every member of the cell array. The other argument may also be a cell
array of strings (of the same size or with only one element), char matrix
or character string.

@strong{Caution:} For compatibility with @sc{Matlab}, Octave's strcmp
function returns 1 if the character strings are equal, and 0 otherwise.
This is just the opposite of the corresponding C library function.
