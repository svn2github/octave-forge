@deftypefn {Function File} {} hist (@var{y}, @var{x}, @var{norm})
Produce histogram counts or plots.

With one vector input argument, plot a histogram of the values with
10 bins.  The range of the histogram bins is determined by the range
of the data.

Given a second scalar argument, use that as the number of bins.

Given a second vector argument, use that as the centers of the bins,
with the width of the bins determined from the adjacent values in
the vector.

If third argument is provided, the histogram is normalised such that
the sum of the bars is equal to @var{norm}.

Extreme values are lumped in the first and last bins.

With two output arguments, produce the values @var{nn} and @var{xx} such
that @code{bar (@var{xx}, @var{nn})} will plot the histogram.
