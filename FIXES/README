Status as of Octave version 2.0.16/2.1.31

To skip all files, add the file NOINSTALL to the directory.

To skip a particular m-file, rename it to *.m-skip.

To skip a particular oct-file, rename it to *.oct-skip.  Note that
the oct-file will reappear the next time you do a make.  To keep
file from being built, remove it from the PROGS line of the Makefile.

Note that you cannot override an octave supplied oct-file unless you 
have configured octave with --enable-shared --enable-lite-kernel. 

Interface changes
=================
lin2mu
   Octave tries to guess based on the input range whether to use 8 bit
   or 16 bit samples.  This behaviour is wrong for quiet 16 bit recordings.
   A warning is issued if Octave guesses it is receiving 8 bit input.

mu2lin
   Octave defaults to returning 8 bit samples.  I have left this behaviour
   in place even though it is a silly default.  Change the default to 0 for
   compatibility with matlab.

rand/randn
   Returns a different sequence for the same seed.

union
   Preserves orientation of the input vectors.

Interface extensions
====================
freqz           (plots filter response)
polyder		(accepts a*b, a/b; auto-reduction of common terms)
polyderiv	(accepts a*b, a/b; auto-reduction of common terms)
polygcd		(new function for auto-reduction on polyder)
mu2lin		(accepts -1:1 audio range; accepts matrix; 3x faster)
lin2mu		(accepts -1:1 audio range; accepts matrix)
grid		(control x/y grids and grid density independently)
fsolve.oct	(allow parameters through fsolve to user function)
rand.oct	(accepts "state" argument; use the Mersenne twister,
		 a long period random number generator)
randn.oct	(same changes as rand.oct)

Bug fixes
=========
tf2zp		(search site:www.octave.org for test case)
zp2tf		(search site:www.octave.org for test case)
sqrtm           (handles ill-conditioned matrices)

Speedups
========
hankel		(for midsized files---better to speed up the interpreter
toeplitz	 by 5x rather than requiring a 5x bigger memory footprint)
triu		 
tril
index
rindex
kron            (both C++ and m-file)
chol.oct	(use triangle matrix type; in extra/linear-algebra/chol.cc)

In Octave 2.1.36
================
cross		(warn if receiving mixed row/column vectors)
cross		(accepts matrices)
contour		(default number of contours; note that usage(...) is wrong)
fftfilt		(accepts matrices)
findstr         (speedup)
freqz		(accepts frequency vector)
imagesc		(only display if not returning scaled image)
invhilb         (extends valid range; faster)
vander          (speedup)
