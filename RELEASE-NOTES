New functions

        * vrml/vmesh: 3D visualization of a surface
        * vrml/*: represent and show 3D objects as VRML code (needs FreeWRL)
        * image/imginfo: determines size of image using 'convert'
	* image/colfilt: image block filtering function
	* miscellaneous/inline: generate a function from an expression
        * miscellaneous/slurp_file: loads a file into a string
        * miscellaneous/{rotv,rotparams}: parameterize 3D rotation matrices
	* plot/contour.f: filled contours
	* sparse/sprand: random sparse matrix
	* splines/pchip: Piecewise Cubic Hermitian Interpolating Polynomial
	* symbolic/{cheb,chebwin}: Dolph-Chebyshev windows

Extended interfaces

	* audio/au{load,save}: support floating point .wav formats
	* image/colorgradient: allow instantaneous transitions (weight 0)
	* optim/wpolyfit: option to fit through origin
	* signal/{ellip,ellipord}: compatible interfac
	* sparse/spy: accept dense matrices
	* strings/mat2string: accept [] and complex
	* symbolic/*: relational operators
	* time/datestr: more format codes; handle vectors of dates

Changed interfaces

	* image/bwlabel: C++ version---may be different from m-file interface
	* extra/ode: moved from v1.06 to v1.14
	* optim/*: unified interface supporting options
	* optim/wpolyfit: don't return yf
	* optim/wpolyfit: return row vectors for compatibility with polyfit
	* signal/nellip: replaced by ellip, ellipord

Internal changes

	* extra/symband: eigenvector bug removed
	* io/dlmread: returned matrix was transposed
	* general/rat: use 1/0 for infinity
	* plot/ginput: m-file version based on grab.cc
	* plot/legend: give gnuplot time to respond to parameter request
	* signal/buttord: parser error
	* sparse/spy: prettier graph
	* symbolic/*: incorporate octave_sym functionality in octave_ex class
	* *: don't use cout/cerr from *.cc functions

Administration

        * vrml/doc: LaTeX tutorial on 3D visualization tools 
	* Octave for Windows FAQ updates
	* INSTALL.WINDOWS installation notes
	* support for static build under Windows

2002-05-09 ============================================================

This is a bug fix release.  Many thanks to the good folks at Debian for
finding the portability problems.

New functions

	* miscellaneous/OCTAVE_FORGE_VERSION
	* extra/tsa/durlev
	* strings/base64encode
	* signal/guasswin
	* image/colfilt

Changes

	* audio/sound: uses ssh rather than rsh for remote audio
	* testfun/assert: use tol>0 for relative error, tol<0 for absolute err
	* optim/bfgs: new interface
	* optim/minimize: ndiff, jac, hess and ihess options
	* NaN/sumskipnan: additional outputs
	* NaN/*: bug fixes

Bug fixes

	* signal/triang: for n=2, peak=1 at the virtual center of the window
	* signal/gaussian: now returns a symmetric window
	* now compiles on most Debian systems which support Octave.
	* updated doc strings, tests

Administration

	* make check and make icheck added.  Only supports the compiled
	  functions at the moment, but it is a start.
