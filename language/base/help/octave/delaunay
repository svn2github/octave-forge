@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{tri}=} delaunay (@var{x}, @var{y})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{tri}=} delaunay (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{opt})
The return matrix of size [n, 3] contains a set triangles which are
described by the indices to the data point x and y vector.
The triangulation satisfies the Delaunay circumcircle criterion.
No other data point is in the circumcircle of the defining triangle.

A third optional argument, which must be a string, contains extra options
passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the documentation for the 
Qhull library for details.

@example
@group
x = rand (1, 10);
y = rand (size (x));
T = delaunay (x, y);
X = [x(T(:,1)); x(T(:,2)); x(T(:,3)); x(T(:,1))];
Y = [y(T(:,1)); y(T(:,2)); y(T(:,3)); y(T(:,1))];
axis ([0,1,0,1]);
plot (X, Y, "b", x, y, "r*");
