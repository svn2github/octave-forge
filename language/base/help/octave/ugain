@deftypefn {Function File} {} ugain (@var{n})
Creates a system with unity gain, no states.
This trivial system is sometimes needed to create arbitrary
complex systems from simple systems with @command{buildssic}.
Watch out if you are forming sampled systems since @command{ugain}
does not contain a sampling period.
