Backports of functions to the latest Octave 2.0.x interpreter.  
Unless you volunteer to keep them up to date, these functions 
will likely fall behind their counterparts in the main
distribution.  Note that you should try to write your functions 
so that they work without change in Octave 2.0.x, but if doing 
so makes them less clean or efficient, then drop 2.0.x 
compatibility and consider making a 2.0.x specific version and 
adding it to the ver20 directory.  By default these are not 
installed.
