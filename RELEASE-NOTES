Tested against octave-2.1.49.  Compiles for 2.1.36 and up.
Some functions will not work with older versions of Octave.  
For versions prior to 2.1.35, use make -k to build whatever 
can be built ignoring the rest.

*** WARNING *** if installing in a user directory, octave may crash
immediately on startup.  Either install into a system directory, or
remove the comm/PKG_ADD and sparse/PKG_ADD and try again
(octave-2.1.49 on RedHat 7.3 exhibits this problem).

2003-06-01 for Octave 2.1.36 and up ==========================================

* Extended support backward to octave 2.1.36 and forward to octave 2.1.49
  for all oct-files.  Some scripts make use of features only available in
  more recent versions of Octave.

* Communications: 
  - sqrt over Galois field
  - BCH code, modulator
  - bug fixes and documentation improvements

* Image:
  - added rotate_scale() 

* Optimization:
  - added Nick Higham's adsmax, mdsmax nmsmax for fmins
  - lp() fix range error

* Plotting:
  - surf()/surfc() support gnuplot 3.8i shaded surfaces
  - added peaks()
  - legend() inside/ouside/boxon/boxoff/right/left

* Signal Processing 
  - added freqs, invfreqs, invfreqz
  - return statespace and laplacian IIR filters (butter, cheby1, cheby2, ellip)
  - fixed aryule() to return the correct filter

* Statistics: 
  - added normplot()
  - scatter() optimization

* Sparse:
  - added concatenation functions spvcat() and sphcat()

* Symbolic: 
  - added poly2sym, sym2poly, numden, findsymbols, findsym, symlsolve, 
    symfsolve, syminfo
  - subs() accepts cell arrays

* TSA/NaN:
  - many bug fixes and documentation improvements

* Miscellaneous:
  - added cellstr()
  - fieldnames() now returns cell array
  - listen() bugfixes
  - ellipke() supports m < 0
  - deal() now supports [a,b] = deal(b,a)
  - dlmread() converted to C++ for speed and more flexible input

* administration: 
  - target specific build instructions (MacOSX, windows, Irix)

2003-02-22 for Octave 2.1.45 =================================================

* Updates for octave 2.1.45

* Parallel: Light weight parallel programming added but flagged NOINSTALL.

* Communications: add galois field functions and others

* Signal Processing: add convmtx and dftmtx

* Geometry: add (poor) griddata/tsearch support --- please improve!!

* VRML: new options 'z(grey|rb|col)' for vmesh() and
  vrml_surf(). Fixes and improvements to many functions.

* NaN: enhanced cov/covm, NaN arithmetic fixes 

* TSA: bug fix (matlab 5.3 bug)

* Sparse: add spstats and x.^a, more robust

* Base functions: add fileparts, filesep, char, dos; improve dlmread

* Function overloading: dispatch() lets you call tf rather than f if the
  first argument to f is t.

* Octave server: listen() sets up a socket to receive octave commands from
  a particular host --- please improve!!

Many fixes, compatibility improvements and better Windows support.

Thanks, all!
