@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {[@var{info}, @var{err}, @var{msg}] =} lstat (@var{file})
Return a structure @var{s} containing the following information about
@var{file}.

@table @code
@item dev
ID of device containing a directory entry for this file.

@item ino
File number of the file.

@item mode
File mode, as an integer.  Use the functions @code{S_ISREG},
@code{S_ISDIR}, @code{S_ISCHR}, @code{S_ISBLK}, @code{S_ISFIFO},
@code{S_ISLNK}, or @code{S_ISSOCK} to extract information from this
value.

@item modestr
File mode, as a string of ten letters or dashes as would be returned by
@kbd{ls -l}.

@item nlink
Number of links.

@item uid
User ID of file's owner.

@item gid
Group ID of file's group.

@item rdev
ID of device for block or character special files.

@item size
Size in bytes.

@item atime
Time of last access in the same form as time values returned from
@code{time}.  @xref{Timing Utilities}.

@item mtime
Time of last modification in the same form as time values returned from
@code{time}.  @xref{Timing Utilities}.

@item ctime
Time of last file status change in the same form as time values
returned from @code{time}.  @xref{Timing Utilities}.

@item blksize
Size of blocks in the file.

@item blocks
Number of blocks allocated for file.
@end table

If the call is successful @var{err} is 0 and @var{msg} is an empty
string.  If the file does not exist, or some other error occurs, @var{s}
is an empty matrix, @var{err} is @minus{}1, and @var{msg} contains the
corresponding system error message.

If @var{file} is a symbolic link, @code{stat} will return information
about the actual file the is referenced by the link.  Use @code{lstat}
if you want information about the symbolic link itself.

For example,

@example
@group
[s, err, msg] = stat ("/vmlinuz")
      @result{} s =
        @{
          atime = 855399756
          rdev = 0
          ctime = 847219094
          uid = 0
          size = 389218
          blksize = 4096
          mtime = 847219094
          gid = 6
          nlink = 1
          blocks = 768
          mode = -rw-r--r--
          modestr = -rw-r--r--
          ino = 9316
          dev = 2049
        @}
     @result{} err = 0
     @result{} msg = 
@end group
