These are the source codes for the conversion
 of a .xml mesh to/from a (p,e,t) mesh.

You need dolfin to compile and execute it:

mkoctfile xml2oct.cc -ldolfin
mkoctfile oct2xml.cc -ldolfin

Under Octave you can run the following example 
for xml2oct with 

mesh = xml2oct("dolfin_fine.xml.gz");
msh2p_mesh(mesh);

(the mesh dolfin has been taken
from the Fenics website, author: A.Logg)

Under Octave you can run the following example 
for xml2oct with 

mesh = msh2m_structured_mesh(linspace(0,1,10),linspace(0,1,20),1,[0 1 2 3]);
oct2xml(mesh,"my_output_name");


if you occur in this error:
octave: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/openmpi/lib/openmpi/mca_paffinity_linux.so: undefined symbol: mca_base_param_reg_int

you can solve it with the following command:
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/libmpi.so
