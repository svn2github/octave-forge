@defvr {Built-in Constant} NaN
@defvrx {Built-in Constant} nan
Not a number.  This is the result of an operation like
@iftex
@tex
$0/0$, or $\infty - \infty$,
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
0/0, or @samp{Inf - Inf},
@end ifinfo
or any operation with a NaN.

Note that NaN always compares not equal to NaN.  This behavior is
specified by the IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic.  To
find NaN values, you must use the @code{isnan} function.
@end defvr
