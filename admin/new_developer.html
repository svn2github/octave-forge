<h2>Contributing Code to the Gnu Octave Repository</h2>
</center>


<h3>Requirements</h3>
To contribute your .m files, C++, C, or Fortran code to the Octave
Repository you need to
<ul>
    <li> have an account on SourceForge,
    <li> be registered as an octave-forge developer,
    <li> have <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>
        installed on the computer from which you
        will submit contributions, and
    <li> have the secure shell,
         <a href="http://www.openssh.com/"><tt>ssh</tt></a>, installed
         on your computer.
</ul>
The first two requirements are easy but may take a few days.  
If you don't already have one, request a SourceForge (SF) account
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php"> here</a>.
To become a developer on octave-forge (octave-forge is the 
CVS project name of the Gnu
Octave Repository) simply email a request to one of the octave-forge
administrators:
<a href="mailto:cgijobs@users.sf.net">cgijobs@users.sf.net</a>,
<a href="mailto:joolean@users.sf.net">joolean@users.sf.net</a>, or
<a href="mailto:pkienzle@users.sf.net">pkienzle@users.sf.net</a>.
Include a bit of information about the code
you plan to submit. 
Finally, if your computer runs linux or
FreeBSD, chances are good that both <tt>ssh</tt> and CVS are already 
installed on your system. 
If they aren't, 
you will need to find prebuilt packages for them or download their
source codes and build them.

<h3>Create a SF home directory</h3>
<p>
If you've never submitted code to a SourceForge project before,
create your home directory by
logging onto the octave-forge account with <tt>ssh</tt>:
<pre>
   $ ssh -l <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>sflogin</i></FONT>  cvs.octave.sourceforge.net
   Password:  <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>your SF password</i></FONT>
</pre>
Although SF will only show you a message-of-the-day screen then log
you out, this process has the useful side effect of creating a home
directory for you if one doesn't already exist.  Some CVS commands will fail
if you do not have a home directory on SF.

<h3>Download the latest octave-forge distribution</h3>
CVS expects the 
code you plan to submit to reside in a directory within the existing
octave-forge directory structure.
You will therefore need to download a copy of the latest octave-forge
distribution to work in.  Change directories to a place you want
to put the code, then issue the CVS <i>checkout</i>
(abreviated as 'co') command:
<pre>
   $ cd <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>working_directory</i></FONT>
   $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
   $ cvs -d:ext:<FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>sflogin</i></FONT>@cvs.octave.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/octave co octave-forge
</pre>

<h3>Where does your code belong?</h3>

Put your file(s) in a subdirectory under the <tt>octave-forge/</tt>
directory.  Here are some guidelines to help you decide where your
code belongs:
<ul>
	<li> <b><tt>FIXES/</tt></b><br>
	Alternatives to existing Octave functions.  Some of these are 
	needed by the functions in <tt>main/</tt>, some are needed for 
	compatibility with Matlab, and some are faster than the Octave
	alternatives.

	<li> <b><tt>doc/</tt></b><br>
	Documentation for octave in general.  Documentation for specific
	packages goes into the <tt>doc/</tt> subdirectory of the individual package 
	directories.  There are no standards for documentation at this
	time.

	<li> <b><tt>extra/</tt></b><br>
	Packages which:
	<ul>     <li> are too narrow in scope for <tt>main/</tt>, or
	    <li> act as alternatives for functions in <tt>main/</tt>, or
	    <li> do not follow octave conventions (because they want
	     to retain compatibility with matlab for example), or
	    <li> are primarily developed elsewhere, or
	    <li> require patches to Octave, or
	    <li> are designed for older versions of Octave, or
	    <li> haven't been tested enough.
</ul>
	<li> <b><tt>extra/patches/</tt></b><br>
	Small patches to Octave. Patches should be labelled as
	name-version.patch, with version being the Octave version 
	number on which the patch was based.  The start of the 
	patch file should contain a description of what it does.  
	Patches should be generated with diff -c or diff -cp.

	<li> <b><tt>extra/ver20/</tt></b><br>
	Backports of functions to the latest Octave 2.0.x interpreter.  
	Unless you volunteer to keep them up to date, these functions 
	will likely fall behind their counterparts in the main
	distribution.  Note that you should try to write your functions 
	so that they work without change in Octave 2.0.x, but if doing 
	so makes them less clean or efficient, then drop 2.0.x 
	compatibility and consider making a 2.0.x specific version and 
	adding it to the ver20 directory.  By default these are not 
	installed.

	<li> <b><tt>main/</tt></b><br>
	Packages which may eventually be included in the main octave 
	distribution.  As such, they should follow Octave conventions.  
	The octave-forge CVS tree should be the primary development/release 
	site.  All functions should work with the latest Octave 
	interpreter without any special compilation switches or patches
	applied.

	<li> <b><tt>nonfree/</tt></b><br>
	Packages which are not freely modifiable and redistributable 
	with modifications, or which depend on code which is not 
	free.  This includes functions which only permit non-commercial 
	use and functions which must be kept together as a package.  
	Functions in all other directories must be freely redistributable 
	with modifications.  Functions in non-free must be freely 
	redistributable for non-commercial use.  Functions of unknown
	license should not be included anywhere, since no license implies
	default license implies no rights to redistribute.

</ul>

<h3>Submit your code!</h3>
You are now ready to upload your code to the Gnu Octave Repository.  
Do this with two CVS commands--one to add a new
entry for your file in the octave-forge catalog, and a second command
to actually upload the file:
<pre>
   $ cvs -d:ext:<FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>sflogin</i></FONT>@cvs.octave.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/octave add <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>file.m</i></FONT>
   $ cvs -d:ext:<FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>sflogin</i></FONT>@cvs.octave.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/octave commit <FONT COLOR="#800000"><i>file.m</i></FONT>
</pre>

After hitting the carriage return at the end of the commit command,
CVS will open your default editor so that you can enter comments about
the commit. The first time you commit a file the comment might be
something as simple as `Initial commit into CVS.' However, for all
subsequent commits please add meaningful comments that explain why
changes were made to the file since all comments will appear in the
changelog.
<p>
Aside:  the default editor can be defined like so:
<pre>
   $ export EDITOR=<FONT COLOR="#800000">vim</FONT>
</pre>

<h3>Learn more about CVS</h3>
The few CVS commands shown here just scratch the surface of this
powerful versioning package.  If you become an active contributor
you will benefit from learning more CVS commands and understanding 
how CVS works.
The
<a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html">
CVS Book</a> is a great place to begin your exploration.

<h3>Join the developers' mailing list</h3>
Finally, consider joining the octave-forge developer's 
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/octave-dev">
mailing list</a>.
