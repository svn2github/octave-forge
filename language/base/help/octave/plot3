@deftypefn {Function File} {} plot3 (@var{args})

This function produces three-dimensional plots.  Many different
combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

@example
plot3 (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{z})
@end example

@noindent
where the arguments are taken to be the vertices of the points to be
plotted in three dimensions. If all arguments are vectors of the same
length, then a single continuous line is drawn. If all arguments are
matrices, then each column of the matrices is treated as a seperate
line. No attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the
number of rows match.

Additionally, only two arguments can be given as

@example
plot3 (@var{x}, @var{c})
@end example

where the real and imaginary parts of the second argument are used as
the @var{y} and @var{z} coordinates, respectively.

If only one argument is given, as

@example
plot3 (@var{c})
@end example

the real and imaginary parts of the argument are used as the @var{y}
and @var{z} values, and they are plotted versus their index.

To save a plot, in one of several image formats such as PostScript
or PNG, use the @code{print} command.

An optional format argument can be given as

@example
plot3 (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{z}, @var{fmt})
@end example

If the @var{fmt} argument is supplied, it is interpreted as
follows.  If @var{fmt} is missing, the default gnuplot line style
is assumed.

@table @samp
@item -
Set lines plot style (default).

@item .
Set dots plot style.

@item @@
Set points plot style.

@item -@@
Set linespoints plot style.

@item ^
Set impulses plot style.

@item L
Set steps plot style.

@item @var{n}
Interpreted as the plot color if @var{n} is an integer in the range 1 to
6.

@item @var{nm}
If @var{nm} is a two digit integer and @var{m} is an integer in the
range 1 to 6, @var{m} is interpreted as the point style.  This is only
valid in combination with the @code{@@} or @code{-@@} specifiers.

@item @var{c}
If @var{c} is one of @code{"k"}, @code{"r"}, @code{"g"}, @code{"b"},
@code{"m"}, @code{"c"}, or @code{"w"}, it is interpreted as the plot
color (black, red, green, blue, magenta, cyan, or white).

@item ";title;"
Here @code{"title"} is the label for the key.

@item +
@itemx *
@itemx o
@itemx x
Used in combination with the points or linespoints styles, set the point
style.
@end table

The color line styles have the following meanings on terminals that
support color.

@example
Number  Gnuplot colors  (lines)points style
  1       red                   *
  2       green                 +
  3       blue                  o
  4       magenta               x
  5       cyan                house
  6       brown            there exists
@end example

The @var{fmt} argument can also be used to assign key titles.
To do so, include the desired title between semi-colons after the
formatting sequence described above, e.g. "+3;Key Title;"
Note that the last semi-colon is required and will generate an error if
it is left out.

Arguments can also be given in groups of three as

@example
plot3 (@var{x1}, @var{y1}, @var{z1}, @var{x2}, @var{y2}, @var{z2}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
where each set of three arguments is treated as a seperate line or
set of lines in three dimensions.

To plot multiple one- or two-argument groups, separate each group with an
empty format string, as

@example
plot3 (@var{x1}, @var{c1}, '', @var{c2}, '', @dots{})
@end example

An example of the use of plot3 is

@example
@group
   z = [0:0.05:5];
   plot3(cos(2*pi*z), sin(2*pi*z), z, ";helix;");
   plot3(z, exp(2i*pi*z), ";complex sinusoid;");
@end group
@end example
