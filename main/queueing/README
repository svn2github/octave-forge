The queueing toolbox ("queueing", in short) is a collection of GNU
Octave scripts for numerical evaluation of queueing network
models. Open, closed and mixed networks are supported, with single or
multiple classes of customers. The queueing toolbox also provides
functions for steady-state and transient analysis of Markov chains, as
well as fo single station queueing systems.

The latest version of the queueing package can be downloaded from

http://www.moreno.marzolla.name/software/queueing/

This package requires GNU Octave; version 3.0.0 or later should work.
The package contains the following directories:

inst/        
	Contains the Octave m-scripts implementing all functions
	provided by the queueing toolbox.

doc/
        Contains the user documentation, which is automatically
        generated from the texinfo strings embedded in the m-scripts.

scripts/ 
        This directory contains some scripts used to extract
        documentation strings from the m-files. The scripts here have
        been taken almost verbatim from the GNU Octave distribution.

examples/
        This directory contains demo functions which are automatically
        extracted from the scripts included in the inst/
        directory. The demo functions are put in this directory so
        that they can be easily embedded into the package documentation.

test/
        This directory contains the script used to execute all
        tests embedded within functions in the inst/ directory.

broken/
	This directory contains scripts which are currently known
	not to work correctly, or which are work-in-progress.

This package can be distributed according to the terms of the GNU
General Public License, version 3 or later. See the file COPYING for
