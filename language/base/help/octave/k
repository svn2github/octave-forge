@deftypefn {Function File} {} kendall (@var{x}, @var{y})
Compute Kendall's @var{tau} for each of the variables specified by
the input arguments.

For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a variable;
vectors are always observations and may be row or column vectors.

@code{kendall (@var{x})} is equivalent to @code{kendall (@var{x},
@var{x})}.

For two data vectors @var{x}, @var{y} of common length @var{n},
Kendall's @var{tau} is the correlation of the signs of all rank
differences of @var{x} and @var{y};  i.e., if both @var{x} and
@var{y} have distinct entries, then

@tex
$$ \tau = {1 \over n(n-1)} \sum_{i,j} {\rm sign}(q_i-q_j) {\rm sign}(r_i-r_j) $$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@example
@group
         1    
tau = -------   SUM sign (q(i) - q(j)) * sign (r(i) - r(j))
      n (n-1)   i,j
@end group
@end example
@end ifnottex

@noindent
in which the
@tex
$q_i$ and $r_i$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@var{q}(@var{i}) and @var{r}(@var{i})
@end ifnottex
 are the ranks of
@var{x} and @var{y}, respectively.

If @var{x} and @var{y} are drawn from independent distributions,
Kendall's @var{tau} is asymptotically normal with mean 0 and variance
@tex
${2 (2n+5) \over 9n(n-1)}$.
@end tex
@ifnottex
@code{(2 * (2@var{n}+5)) / (9 * @var{n} * (@var{n}-1))}.
@end ifnottex
@end deftypefn
