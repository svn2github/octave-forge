@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {} inline (@var{str}, @var{n})
Create an inline function from the character string @var{str}.
If called with a single argument, the arguments of the generated
function are extracted from the function itself. The generated
function arguments will then be in alphabetical order. It should
be noted that i, and j are ignored as arguments due to the
ambiguity between their use as a variable or their use as an inbuilt
constant. All arguments followed by a parentheses are considered
to be functions.

If the second and subsequent arguments are character strings,
they are the names of the arguments of the function.

If the second argument is an integer @var{n}, the arguments are
@code{"x"}, @code{"P1"}, @dots{}, @code{"P@var{N}"}.
