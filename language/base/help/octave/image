@deftypefn {Function File} {} image (@var{x}, @var{zoom})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} image (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{A}, @var{zoom})
Display a matrix as a color image.  The elements of @var{x} are indices
into the current colormap and should have values between 1 and the
length of the colormap.  If @var{zoom} is omitted, the image will be
scaled to fit within 600x350 (to a max of 4).

It first tries to use @code{gnuplot}, then @code{display} from 
@code{ImageMagick}, then @code{xv}, and then @code{xloadimage}.
The actual program used can be changed using the @code{image_viewer}
function.

The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified in
@var{x} and @var{y}. If you're not using gnuplot 4.2 or later, these
variables are ignored.
