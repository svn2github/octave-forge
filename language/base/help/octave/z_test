@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{z}] =} z_test (@var{x}, @var{m}, @var{v}, @var{alt})
Perform a Z-test of the null hypothesis @code{mean (@var{x}) ==
@var{m}} for a sample @var{x} from a normal distribution with unknown
mean and known variance @var{v}.  Under the null, the test statistic
@var{z} follows a standard normal distribution.

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
@code{mean (@var{x}) != @var{m}}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
one-sided alternative @code{mean (@var{x}) > @var{m}} is considered.
Similarly for @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative @code{mean
(@var{x}) < @var{m}} is considered.  The default is the two-sided
case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed
along with some information.
