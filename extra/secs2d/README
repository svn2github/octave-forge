REQUIREMENTS

To use this software you will need a version of 
GNU Octave compiled with sparse matrix support
this means you need at  least version 2.9.4

If you want to take advantage of the speed-up
given by the c++ reimplementation of some basic
functions, you will also need to have the Octave
C++ API tools installed, but if you don't the code
will work exactly the same using the m-file 
implementation.

For more info on GNU Octave visit 
http://www.octave.org

To have the SECS2D functions available as
Octave commands you just need to add this
directory and its subdirectories to the 
Octave path.

You can do this by running Octave from this
directory and then typing:

Usetpath(pwd)

If you want to use the .oct functions you
will also need to build them from source.
If you have GNU make, gcc and GNU octave properly
installed just typing 

make

should work
