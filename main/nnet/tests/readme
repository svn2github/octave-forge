subdirectory MLP:
=================

MLPScripts.m:
-------------
to run some very basic tests please run
MLPScripts. This will run all scripts
inside the subdirectories "example1" and
"example2".
If no error occur, the first test is passed :-)

nnetTest.m
----------
these tests don't run on the windows version of octave-forge.
Please use a linux/unix version. I tested it on octave-3.0.0
compiled on ubuntu.
