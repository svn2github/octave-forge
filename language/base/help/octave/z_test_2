@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{z}] =} z_test_2 (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{v_x}, @var{v_y}, @var{alt})
For two samples @var{x} and @var{y} from normal distributions with
unknown means and known variances @var{v_x} and @var{v_y}, perform a
Z-test of the hypothesis of equal means.  Under the null, the test
statistic @var{z} follows a standard normal distribution.

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
@code{mean (@var{x}) != mean (@var{y})}.  If alt is @code{">"}, the
one-sided alternative @code{mean (@var{x}) > mean (@var{y})} is used.
Similarly for @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative @code{mean
(@var{x}) < mean (@var{y})} is used.  The default is the two-sided
case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed
along with some information.
