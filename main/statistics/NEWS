Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.1.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** IMPORTANT note about `fstat' shadowing core library function:

    GNU octave's 3.2 release added a new function `fstat' to return
    information of a file. Statistics' `fstat' computes F mean and
    variance. Since MatLab's `fstat' is the equivalent to statistics'
    `fstat' (not to core's `fstat'), and to avoid problems with the
    statistics package, `fstat' has been deprecated in octave 3.4
    and will be removed in Octave 3.8. In the mean time, please
    ignore this warning when installing the package.

 ** The following functions are new in 1.1.0:

      normalise_distribution  repanova  combnk

 ** The following functions were removed since equivalents are now
    part of GNU octave core:

      prctile

 ** The __tbl_delim__ function is now private.

 ** The function `boxplot' now accepts named arguments.

 ** Bug fixes on the functions:

      harmmean  nanmax  nanmin  regress

 ** Small improvements on help text.
