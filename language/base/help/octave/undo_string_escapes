@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} undo_string_escapes (@var{s})
Converts special characters in strings back to their escaped forms.  For
example, the expression

@example
bell = "\a";
@end example

@noindent
assigns the value of the alert character (control-g, ASCII code 7) to
the string variable @code{bell}.  If this string is printed, the
system will ring the terminal bell (if it is possible).  This is
normally the desired outcome.  However, sometimes it is useful to be
able to print the original representation of the string, with the
special characters replaced by their escape sequences.  For example,

@example
octave:13> undo_string_escapes (bell)
ans = \a
@end example

@noindent
replaces the unprintable alert character with its printable
representation.
@end deftypefn
