@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{y} =} speye (@var{sz})
Returns a sparse identity matrix. This is significantly more
efficient than @code{sparse (eye (@var{m}))} as the full matrix
is not constructed.

Called with a single argument a square matrix of size @var{m} by
@var{m} is created. Otherwise a matrix of @var{m} by @var{n} is
created. If called with a single vector argument, this argument 
is taken to be the size of the matrix to create.
