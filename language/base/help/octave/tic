@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} tic ()
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {} toc ()
Set or check a wall-clock timer.  Calling @code{tic} without an
output argument sets the timer.  Subsequent calls to @code{toc}
return the number of seconds since the timer was set.  For example,

@example
tic ();
# many computations later...
elapsed_time = toc ();
@end example

@noindent
will set the variable @code{elapsed_time} to the number of seconds since
the most recent call to the function @code{tic}.

If called with one output argument then this function returns a scalar
of type @code{uint64} and the wall-clock timer is not started.

@example
@group
t = tic; sleep (5); (double (tic ()) - double (t)) * 1e-6
     @result{} 5
@end group
@end example

Nested timing with @code{tic} and @code{toc} is not supported.
Therefore @code{toc} will always return the elapsed time from the most
recent call to @code{tic}.

If you are more interested in the CPU time that your process used, you
should use the @code{cputime} function instead.  The @code{tic} and
@code{toc} functions report the actual wall clock time that elapsed
between the calls.  This may include time spent processing other jobs or
doing nothing at all.  For example,

@example
@group
tic (); sleep (5); toc ()
     @result{} 5
t = cputime (); sleep (5); cputime () - t
     @result{} 0
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(This example also illustrates that the CPU timer may have a fairly
coarse resolution.)
