@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{T} =} delaunayn (@var{P}, @var{opt})
Form the Delaunay triangulation for a set of points.
The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation of the convex hull of the
points such that no n-sphere defined by the n-triangles contains
any other points from the set.
The input matrix @var{P} of size @code{[n, dim]} contains @var{n}
points in a space of dimension dim. The return matrix @var{T} has the
size @code{[m, dim+1]}.  It contains for each row a set of indices to
the points, which describes a simplex of dimension dim.  For example,
a 2d simplex is a triangle and 3d simplex is a tetrahedron.

Extra options for the underlying Qhull command can be specified by the
second argument. This argument is a cell array of strings. The default
options depend on the dimension of the input: 

@itemize 
@item  2D and 3D: @var{opt} = @code{@{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc"@}}
@item  4D and higher: @var{opt} = @code{@{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc", "Qz"@}} 
@end itemize

If @var{opt} is [], then the default arguments are used. If @var{opt}
is @code{@{"@w{}"@}}, then none of the default arguments are used by Qhull. 
See the Qhull documentation for the available options. 

All options can also be specified as single string, for example
@code{"Qt Qbb Qc Qz"}.
