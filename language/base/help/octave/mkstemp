@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {[@var{fid}, @var{name}, @var{msg}] =} mkstemp (@var{template}, @var{delete})
Return the file ID corresponding to a new temporary file with a unique
name created from @var{template}.  The last six characters of @var{template}
must be @code{XXXXXX} and these are replaced with a string that makes the
filename unique.  The file is then created with mode read/write and
permissions that are system dependent (on GNU/Linux systems, the permissions
will be 0600 for versions of glibc 2.0.7 and later).  The file is opened
with the @code{O_EXCL} flag.

If the optional argument @var{delete} is supplied and is true,
the file will be deleted automatically when Octave exits, or when
the function @code{purge_tmp_files} is called.

If successful, @var{fid} is a valid file ID, @var{name} is the name of
the file, and and @var{msg} is an empty string.  Otherwise, @var{fid}
is -1, @var{name} is empty, and @var{msg} contains a system-dependent
error message.
