@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{h} =} stem (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{linespec})
Plot a stem graph and return the handles of the line and marker
objects used to draw the stems.  The default color is @code{"r"}
(red).  The default line style is @code{"-"} and the default marker is
@code{"o"}.

For example,
@example
x = 1:10;
stem (x);
@end example
@noindent
plots 10 stems with heights from 1 to 10;

@example
x = 1:10;
y = ones (1, length (x))*2.*x;
stem (x, y);
@end example
@noindent
plots 10 stems with heights from 2 to 20;

@example
x = 1:10;
y = ones (size (x))*2.*x;
h = stem (x, y, "b");
@end example
@noindent
plots 10 bars with heights from 2 to 20
(the color is blue, and @var{h} is a 2-by-10 array of handles in
which the first row holds the line handles and
the second row holds the marker handles);

@example
x = 1:10;
y = ones (size (x))*2.*x;
h = stem (x, y, "-.k");
@end example
@noindent
plots 10 stems with heights from 2 to 20
(the color is black, line style is @code{"-."}, and @var{h} is a 2-by-10
array of handles in which the first row holds the line handles and
the second row holds the marker handles);

@example
x = 1:10;
y = ones (size (x))*2.*x;
h = stem (x, y, "-.k.");
@end example
@noindent
plots 10 stems with heights from 2 to 20
(the color is black, line style is @code{"-."} and the marker style
is @code{"."}, and @var{h} is a 2-by-10 array of handles in which the
first row holds the line handles and the second row holds the marker
handles);

@example
x = 1:10;
y = ones (size (x))*2.*x;
h = stem (x, y, "fill");
@end example
@noindent
plots 10 stems with heights from 2 to 20
(the color is rgb-triple defined, the line style is @code{"-"},
the marker style is @code{"o"}, and @var{h} is a 2-by-10 array of
handles in which the first row holds the line handles and the second
row holds the marker handles).

Color definitions with rgb-triples are not valid!
