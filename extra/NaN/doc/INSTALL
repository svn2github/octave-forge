Installing the NaN-tb for Octave and Matlab:
--------------------------------------------
a) Extract files and save them in /your/directory/structure/to/NaN/

b) Include the path with one of the following commands: 

        HOME = getenv('HOME');   % if needed, change path to /your/directory/structure/to/

	addpath([HOME,'/NaN/')
	addpath([HOME,'/NaN/inst')
	addpath([HOME,'/NaN/src')

   Make sure the functions in the NaN-toolbox are found before the default functions.
   The NaN-toolbox contains some functions like mean, var, std, cor, cov, and corrcoef 
   which work equivalently than the orginal function - the only exception is that 
   missing values (NaN) are skipped. [You can turn off that behavior by 
   settting flag_implicit_skip_nan(0) ].
   Alternatively, You can avoid this by including the directories at the end of the path
   
	addpath([HOME,'/NaN/','-end')
	addpath([HOME,'/NaN/inst','-end')
	addpath([HOME,'/NaN/src','-end')

c) Several mex-files are strongly recommened. 	
   Run MAKE from the directory .../NaN/src/ 	

   This is well tested on Linux, but might not work completely on other platforms. 
   Specifically, on Windows you need to setup gnumex and gcc (typically mingw or cygwin).  
   (covm_mex and sumskipnan_mex are strongly recommended for performance reasons,  
   train.mex and svmtrain_mex are needed when using support vector machines)  

d) run NANINSTTEST 
This checks whether the installation was successful.
