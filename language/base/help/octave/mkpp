@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{pp} = } mkpp (@var{x}, @var{p})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{pp} = } mkpp (@var{x}, @var{p}, @var{d})

Construct a piece-wise polynomial structure from sample points
@var{x} and coefficients @var{p}.  The ith row of @var{p},
@code{@var{p} (@var{i},:)}, contains the coefficients for the polynomial
over the @var{i}-th interval, ordered from highest to 
lowest. There must be one row for each interval in @var{x}, so 
@code{rows (@var{p}) == length (@var{x}) - 1}.  

You can concatenate multiple polynomials of the same order over the 
same set of intervals using @code{@var{p} = [ @var{p1}; @var{p2}; 
@dots{}; @var{pd} ]}.  In this case, @code{rows (@var{p}) == @var{d} 
* (length (@var{x}) - 1)}.

@var{d} specifies the shape of the matrix @var{p} for all except the
last dimension. If @var{d} is not specified it will be computed as
@code{round (rows (@var{p}) / (length (@var{x}) - 1))} instead.
