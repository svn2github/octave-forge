Summary of important user-visible changes for releases of the control package

===============================================================================
control-2.x.yy   Release Date: 2011-xx-yy   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

** hsvd.m
   -- Use scaling unless state-space model property "scaled" is set to true.

** @lti/norm.m
   -- Use scaling for computation of L-infinity norm unless state-space model
      property "scaled" is set to true.
      
** @lti/minreal.m
   -- Use scaling for state-space and descriptor state-space models unless
      property "scaled" is set to true.
   -- More accurate results are to be expected for descriptor state-space
      models by performing only those reduction phases where effective order
      reduction occurs. This is achieved by saving the system matrices before
      each phase and restoring them if no order reduction took place.
  
** @lti/zero.m
   -- Use scaling for state-space and descriptor state-space models unless
      property "scaled" is set to true.

** @lti/frdata.m
   -- The frequency response is now returned correctly as an array and not as a
      vector, unless the "vector" option is set and the system is single-input
      single-output.
   -- Added help text.


===============================================================================
control-2.1.51   Release Date: 2011-07-21   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

** frd.m
   -- Support for Frequency Response Data (frd) measurement "models".


===============================================================================
control-2.1.50   Release Date: 2011-07-06   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

** ss.m
   -- Support for property "scaled".  By default, it is set to "false".

** @lti/prescale.m
   -- Scaling for state-space models (SLICOT TB01ID) and descriptor models
      (SLICOT TG01AD).
   
** @lti/freqresp.m
   -- Scale state-space models using @lti/prescale.m if property "scaled" is
      set to "false".  Frequency response commands now perform automatic
      scaling unless model property "scaled" is set to "true".


===============================================================================
control-2.0.2   Release Date: 2011-03-18   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

** lsim.m
   -- Fixed a logical error that refused valid initial state vectors.  It was
      due to a thinko introduced with the changes in control-2.0.1.
      (Thanks to Rob Frohne)


===============================================================================
control-2.0.1   Release Date: 2011-03-06   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

** lsim.m
   -- Support time vectors not starting at zero. (Thanks to Rob Frohne)
   -- Improved help text.

** @lti/zero.m
   -- The gain of descriptor state-space models is now computed correctly.
      (fingers crossed)


===============================================================================
control-2.0.0   Release Date: 2011-02-08   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

** First official release.
