@deffn {Command} edit_history options
If invoked with no arguments, @code{edit_history} allows you to edit the
history list using the editor named by the variable @code{EDITOR}.  The
commands to be edited are first copied to a temporary file.  When you
exit the editor, Octave executes the commands that remain in the file.
It is often more convenient to use @code{edit_history} to define functions 
rather than attempting to enter them directly on the command line.
By default, the block of commands is executed as soon as you exit the
editor.  To avoid executing any commands, simply delete all the lines
from the buffer before exiting the editor.

The @code{edit_history} command takes two optional arguments specifying
the history numbers of first and last commands to edit.  For example,
the command

@example
edit_history 13
@end example

@noindent
extracts all the commands from the 13th through the last in the history
list.  The command

@example
edit_history 13 169
@end example

@noindent
only extracts commands 13 through 169.  Specifying a larger number for
the first command than the last command reverses the list of commands
before placing them in the buffer to be edited.  If both arguments are
omitted, the previous command in the history list is used.
