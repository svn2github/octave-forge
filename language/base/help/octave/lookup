@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{idx} =} lookup (@var{table}, @var{y})
Lookup values in a sorted table.  Usually used as a prelude to
interpolation.

If table is strictly increasing and @code{idx = lookup (table, y)}, then
@code{table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))} for all @code{y(i)}
within the table.  If @code{y(i)} is before the table, then 
@code{idx(i)} is 0. If @code{y(i)} is after the table then
@code{idx(i)} is @code{table(n)}.

If the table is strictly decreasing, then the tests are reversed.
There are no guarantees for tables which are non-monotonic or are not
strictly monotonic.

To get an index value which lies within an interval of the table,
use:

@example
idx = lookup (table(2:length(table)-1), y) + 1
@end example

@noindent
This expression puts values before the table into the first
interval, and values after the table into the last interval.
@end deftypefn
