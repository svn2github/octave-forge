@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{u}, @var{h}, @var{nu}] =} krylov (@var{a}, @var{v}, @var{k}, @var{eps1}, @var{pflg})
Construct an orthogonal basis @var{u} of block Krylov subspace

@example
[v a*v a^2*v ... a^(k+1)*v]
@end example

@noindent
Using Householder reflections to guard against loss of orthogonality.

If @var{v} is a vector, then @var{h} contains the Hessenberg matrix
such that @code{a*u == u*h}.  Otherwise, @var{h} is meaningless.

The value of @var{nu} is the dimension of the span of the krylov
subspace (based on @var{eps1}).

If @var{b} is a vector and @var{k} is greater than @var{m-1}, then
@var{h} contains the Hessenberg decompostion of @var{a}.

The optional parameter @var{eps1} is the threshold for zero.  The
default value is 1e-12.

If the optional parameter @var{pflg} is nonzero, row pivoting is used
to improve numerical behavior.  The default value is 0.
