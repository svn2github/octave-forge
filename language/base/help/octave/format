@deffn {Command} format options
Control the format of the output produced by @code{disp} and Octave's
normal echoing mechanism.  Valid options are listed in the following
table.

@table @code
@item short
Octave will try to print numbers with at
least 5 significant figures within a field that is a maximum of 10
characters wide (not counting additional spacing that is added between
columns of a matrix).

If Octave is unable to format a matrix so that columns line up on the
decimal point and all the numbers fit within the maximum field width,
it switches to an @samp{e} format.

@item long
Octave will try to print numbers with at least 15 significant figures
within a field that is a maximum of 20 characters wide (not counting
additional spacing that is added between columns of a matrix).

As will the @samp{short} format, Octave will switch to an @samp{e}
format if it is unable to format a matrix so that columns line up on the
decimal point and all the numbers fit within the maximum field width.

@item long e
@itemx short e
The same as @samp{format long} or @samp{format short} but always display
output with an @samp{e} format.  For example, with the @samp{short e}
format, @code{pi} is displayed as @code{3.14e+00}.

@item long E
@itemx short E
The same as @samp{format long e} or @samp{format short e} but always
display output with an uppercase @samp{E} format.  For example, with
the @samp{long E} format, @code{pi} is displayed as
@code{3.14159265358979E+00}.
@item long g
@itemx short g
Choose between normal @samp{long} (or @samp{short}) and and
@samp{long e} (or @samp{short e}) formats based on the magnitude
of the number.  For example, with the @samp{short g} format,
@code{pi .^ [2; 4; 8; 16; 32]} is displayed as

@example
@group
ans =

      3.1416
      9.8696
      97.409
      9488.5
  9.0032e+07
  8.1058e+15
@end group
@end example

@item long G
@itemx short G
The same as @samp{format long g} or @samp{format short g} but use an
uppercase @samp{E} format.  For example, with the @samp{short G} format,
@code{pi .^ [2; 4; 8; 16; 32]} is displayed as

@example
@group
ans =

      3.1416
      9.8696
      97.409
      9488.5
  9.0032E+07
  8.1058E+15
@end group
@end example

@item free
@itemx none
Print output in free format, without trying to line up columns of
matrices on the decimal point.  This also causes complex numbers to be
formatted like this @samp{(0.604194, 0.607088)} instead of like this
@samp{0.60419 + 0.60709i}.

@item bank
Print in a fixed format with two places to the right of the decimal
point.

@item +
@itemx + @var{chars}
@itemx plus
@itemx plus @var{chars}
Print a @samp{+} symbol for nonzero matrix elements and a space for zero
matrix elements.  This format can be very useful for examining the
structure of a large matrix.

The optional argument @var{chars} specifies a list of 3 characters to use
for printing values greater than zero, less than zero and equal to zero.
For example, with the @samp{+ "+-."} format, @code{[1, 0, -1; -1, 0, 1]}
is displayed as

@example
@group
ans =

+.-
-.+
@end group
@end example

@itemx native-hex
Print the hexadecimal representation numbers as they are stored in
memory.  For example, on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values
in IEEE format with the least significant byte first, the value of
@code{pi} when printed in @code{hex} format is @code{400921fb54442d18}.
This format only works for numeric values.

@item hex
The same as @code{native-hex}, but always print the most significant
byte first.
@item native-bit
Print the bit representation of numbers as stored in memory.
For example, the value of @code{pi} is

@example
@group
01000000000010010010000111111011
01010100010001000010110100011000
@end group
@end example

(shown here in two 32 bit sections for typesetting purposes) when
printed in bit format on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values
in IEEE format with the least significant byte first.  This format only
works for numeric types.
@item bit
The same as @code{native-bit}, but always print the most significant
bits first.
@item compact
Remove extra blank space around column number labels.
@item loose
Insert blank lines above and below column number labels (this is the
default).
@end table

By default, Octave will try to print numbers with at least 5 significant
figures within a field that is a maximum of 10 characters wide.

If Octave is unable to format a matrix so that columns line up on the
decimal point and all the numbers fit within the maximum field width,
it switches to an @samp{e} format.

If @code{format} is invoked without any options, the default format
state is restored.
@end deffn
