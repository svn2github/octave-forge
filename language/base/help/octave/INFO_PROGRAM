@defvr {Built-in Variable} INFO_PROGRAM
The variable @code{INFO_PROGRAM} names the info program to run.  Its
default initial value is
@code{"@var{octave-home}/libexec/octave/@var{version}/exec/@var{arch}/info"}
in which @var{octave-home} is the directory where all of Octave is
installed, @var{version} is the Octave version number, and @var{arch}
is the system type (for example, @code{i686-pc-linux-gnu}).  The
default initial value may be overridden by the environment variable
@code{OCTAVE_INFO_PROGRAM}, or the command line argument
@code{--info-program NAME}, or by setting the value of
@code{INFO_PROGRAM} in a startup script
@end defvr
