@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {[@var{pid}, @var{msg}] =} fork ()
Create a copy of the current process.

Fork can return one of the following values:

@table @asis
@item > 0
You are in the parent process.  The value returned from @code{fork} is
the process id of the child process.  You should probably arrange to
wait for any child processes to exit.

@item 0
You are in the child process.  You can call @code{exec} to start another
process.  If that fails, you should probably call @code{exit}.

@item < 0
The call to @code{fork} failed for some reason.  You must take evasive
action.  A system dependent error message will be waiting in @var{msg}.
@end table
@end deftypefn
