@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {[@var{pid}, @var{status}, @var{msg}] =} waitpid (@var{pid}, @var{options})
Wait for process @var{pid} to terminate.  The @var{pid} argument can be:

@table @asis
@item @minus{}1
Wait for any child process.

@item 0
Wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to that of
the Octave interpreter process.

@item > 0
Wait for termination of the child process with ID @var{pid}.
@end table

The @var{options} argument can be a bitwise OR of zero or more of
the following constants:

@table @code
@item 0
Wait until signal is received or a child process exits (this is the
default if the @var{options} argument is missing).

@item WNOHANG
Do not hang if status is not immediately available.

@item WUNTRACED
Report the status of any child processes that are stopped, and whose
status has not yet been reported since they stopped.

@item WCONTINUED
Return if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of @code{SIGCONT}.
This value may not be meaningful on all systems.
@end table

If the returned value of @var{pid} is greater than 0, it is the process
ID of the child process that exited.  If an error occurs, @var{pid} will
be less than zero and @var{msg} will contain a system-dependent error
message.  The value of @var{status} contains additional system-depenent
information about the subprocess that exited.
