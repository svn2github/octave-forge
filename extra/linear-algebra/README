Subject: Upper Triangle/Lower Triangle matrix by CHOL

Hi,
   The attached file will allow CHOL to return a upper triangle/lower =
triangle matrix, so that ldiv can be done more efficiently. Any other =
operations will get passed to octave_matrix. I.e. typical code could be:
  c = chol(a)
  x = c\ (c' \ b)

  To compile:
    mkoctfile *.cc -o chol.oct
  and copy chol.oct into your libexec/octave/site/oct directory.

Regards,
Jianming
