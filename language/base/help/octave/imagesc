Display a scaled version of the matrix @var{A} as a color image.  The
matrix is scaled so that its entries are indices into the current
colormap.  The scaled matrix is returned.  If @var{zoom} is omitted, a
comfortable size is chosen.  If @var{limits} = [@var{lo}, @var{hi}] are
given, then that range maps into the full range of the colormap rather 
than the minimum and maximum values of @var{A}.

The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified in
@var{x} and @var{y}, either as pairs giving the minimum and maximum
values for the respective axes, or as values for each row and column
of the matrix @var{A}.  At present they are ignored.
