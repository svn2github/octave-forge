@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} resize (@var{x}, @var{m})
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {} resize (@var{x}, @var{m}, @var{n})
Destructively resize @var{x}.

@strong{Values in @var{x} are not preserved as they are with
@code{reshape}.}

If only @var{m} is supplied and it is a scalar, the dimension of the
result is @var{m}-by-@var{m}.  If @var{m} is a vector, then the
dimensions of the result are given by the elements of @var{m}.
If both @var{m} and @var{n} are scalars, then the dimensions of
the result are @var{m}-by-@var{n}.
