@deftypefn {Function File} {} findstr (@var{s}, @var{t}, @var{overlap})
Return the vector of all positions in the longer of the two strings
@var{s} and @var{t} where an occurrence of the shorter of the two starts.
If the optional argument @var{overlap} is nonzero, the returned vector
can include overlapping positions (this is the default).  For example,

@example
findstr ("ababab", "a")
@result{} [ 1, 3, 5 ]
findstr ("abababa", "aba", 0)
@result{} [ 1, 5 ]
@end example
@end deftypefn
