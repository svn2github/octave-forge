@deftypefn {Function File} {} image (@var{img})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} image (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{img})
Display a matrix as a color image.  The elements of @var{x} are indices
into the current colormap, and the colormap will be scaled so that the
extremes of @var{x} are mapped to the extremes of teh colormap.

It first tries to use @code{gnuplot}, then @code{display} from 
@code{ImageMagick}, then @code{xv}, and then @code{xloadimage}.
The actual program used can be changed using the @code{image_viewer}
function.

The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified in
@var{x} and @var{y}. If you're not using gnuplot 4.2 or later, these
variables are ignored.
