Summary of important user-visible changes for queueing-1.1.0

** Function ctmc_exps() can now compute the expected sojourn time
   until absorption for absorming CTMC

** Functions ctmc_exps() and ctmc_taexps() now accept a scalar as
   the second argument (time). 

** Function ctmc_bd() now returns the infinitesimal generator matrix Q
   of the birth-death process with given rates, not the steady-state
   solution.

** The following new functions have been added: dtmc_bd(), dtmc_mtta(), 
   ctmc_check_Q(), dtmc_exps(), dtmc_taexps()

** The following deprecated functions have been removed: ctmc_bd_solve(),
   ctmc_solve(), dtmc_solve()
