@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{z}] =} u_test (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
For two samples @var{x} and @var{y}, perform a Mann-Whitney U-test of
the null hypothesis PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) == 1/2 == PROB (@var{x}
< @var{y}).  Under the null, the test statistic @var{z} approximately
follows a standard normal distribution.  Note that this test is
equivalent to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) != 1/2.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
one-sided alternative PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) > 1/2 is considered.
Similarly for @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative PROB (@var{x} >
@var{y}) < 1/2 is considered.  The default is the two-sided case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
