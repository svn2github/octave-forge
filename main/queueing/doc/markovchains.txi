@section Discrete-Time Markov Chains

Let @math{X_0, X_1, @dots{}, X_n, @dots{} } be a sequence of random
variables, each one defined over a discete state space @math{0, 1, 2,
@dots{}}. The sequence @math{X_0, X_1, @dots{}, X_n, @dots{}}  is a
@emph{stochastic process} with discrete time @math{0, 1, 2,
@dots{}}. A @emph{Markov chain} is a stochastic process @math{@{X_n,
n=0, 1, 2, @dots{}@}} which satisfies the following Marrkov property:

@iftex
@tex
$$P(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1}\ |\ X_n = x_n, X_{n-1} = x_{n-1}, \ldots, X_0 = x_0) = P(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1}\ |\ X_n = x_n)$$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@math{P(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1} | X_n = x_n, X_{n-1} = x_{n-1}, ..., X_0 = x_0) = P(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1} | X_n = x_n)}
@end ifnottex

@noindent which means that the probability that the system is in 
a particular state at time @math{n+1} only depends on the state the
system was at time @math{n}.

The evolution of a Markov chain with finite state space @math{@{1, 2,
@dots{}, N@}} can be fully described by a stochastic matrix @math{{\bf
P}(n) = P_{i,j}(n)} such that @math{P_{i, j}(n) = P( X_{n+1} = j\ |\
X_n = j )}.  If the Markov chain is homogeneous (that is, the
transition probability matrix @math{{\bf P}(n)} is time-independent),
we can simply write @math{{\bf P} = P_{i, j}}, where @math{P_{i, j} =
P( X_{n+1} = j\ |\ X_n = j )} for all @math{n=0, 1, 2, @dots{}}.

The transition probability matrix @math{\bf P} must satisfy the
following two properties: (1) @math{P_{i, j} @geq{} 0} for all
@math{i, j}, and (2) @math{\sum_{j=1}^N P_{i,j} = 1}. We denote with
@math{{\bf \pi}(n) = (\pi_1(n), \pi_2(n), @dots{}, \pi_N(n) )} the
@emph{state occupancy probability vector} at step
@math{n}. @math{\pi_i(n)} denotes the probability that the system is
in state @math{i} at step @math{n}.

Given the transition probability matrix @math{\bf P} and the initial
state occupancy probability vector @math{{\bf \pi}(0) = (\pi_1(0),
\pi_2(0), @dots{}, \pi_N(0))} at step 0, the state occupancy
probability vector @math{{\bf \pi}(n)} at step @math{n} can be
computed as:

@iftex
@tex
$${\bf \pi}(n) = {\bf \pi}(0) {\bf P}^n$$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@example
@group
\pi(n) = \pi(0) P^n
@end group
@end example
@end ifnottex

Under certain conditions, there exists a @emph{stationary state
occupancy probability} @math{{\bf \pi} = \lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty}
{\bf \pi}(n)}, which is independent from the initial state occupancy
@math{{\bf \pi}(0)}. The stationary state occupancy probability vector
@math{\bf \pi} satisfies @math{{\bf \pi} = {\bf \pi} {\bf P}}.

The First Passage Time @math{M_{i j}} is defined as the average
number of transitions needed to visit state @math{j} for the first
time, starting from state @math{i}. Matrix @math{\bf M} satisfies the
property that

@iftex

$$ M_{i j} = 1 + \sum_{k \neq j} P_{i k} M_{k j}$$

Consider a two-state CTMC such that transition rates between states
are equal to 1. This can be solved as follows:

@example
@group
@verbatiminclude @value{top_srcdir}/examples/demo_1_ctmc.m
    @result{} q = 0.50000   0.50000

@node Expected Sojourn Time
@subsection Expected Sojourn Time

Given a @math{N} state continuous-time Markov Chain with infinitesimal
generator matrix @math{\bf Q}, we define the vector @math{{\bf L}(t) =
(L_1(t), L_2(t), \ldots L_N(t))} such that @math{L_i(t)} is the
expected sojourn time in state @math{i} during the interval
@math{[0,t)}, assuming that the initial occupancy probability at time
0 was @math{{\bf \pi}(0)}. Then, @math{{\bf L}(t)} is the solution of
the following differential equation:

@iftex
@tex
$$ { d{\bf L}(t) \over dt} = {\bf L}(t){\bf Q} + {\bf \pi}(0), \qquad {\bf L}(0) = {\bf 0} $$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@example
@group
 dL
 --(t) = L(t) Q + pi(0),    L(0) = 0
 dt
@end group
@end example
@end ifnottex

The function @code{ctmc_exps} can be used to compute @math{{\bf
L}(t)}, by using the @code{lsode} Octave function to solve the above
linear differential equation.

@DOCSTRING(ctmc_exps)

@noindent @strong{EXAMPLE}

Let us consider a pure-birth, 4-states CTMC such that the transition
rate from state @math{i} to state @math{i+1} is @math{\lambda_i = i
\lambda} (@math{i=1, 2, 3}), with @math{\lambda = 0.5}. The following
code computes the expected sojourn time in state @math{i},
given the initial occupancy probability @math{p_0=(1,0,0,0)}.

@node Expected Time to Absorption
@subsection Expected Time to Absorption

If we consider a Markov Chain with absorbing states, it is possible to
define the @emph{expected time to absorption} as the expected time
until the system goes into an absorbing state. More specifically, let
us suppose that @math{A} is the set of transient (i.e., non-absorbing)
states of a CTMC with @math{N} states and infinitesimal generator
matrix @math{\bf Q}. The expected time to absorption @math{{\bf
L}_A(\infty)} is defined as the solution of the following equation:

@iftex
@tex
$$ {\bf L}_A(\infty){\bf Q}_A = -{\bf \pi}_A(0) $$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@example
@group
L_A( inf ) Q_A = -pi_A(0)
@end group
@end example
@end ifnottex

@noindent where @math{{\bf Q}_A} is the restriction of matrix @math{\bf Q} to
only states in @math{A}, and @math{{\bf \pi}_A(0)} is the initial
state occupancy probability at time 0, restricted to states in
@math{A}.

@DOCSTRING(ctmc_mtta)

@noindent @strong{EXAMPLE}

Let us consider a simple model of a redundant disk array. We assume
that the array is made of 5 independent disks, such that the array can
tolerate up to 2 disk failures without losing data. If three or more
disks break, the array is dead and unrecoverable. We want to estimate
the Mean-Time-To-Failure (MTTF) of the disk array.

We model this system as a 4 states Markov chain with state space
@math{\{ 2, 3, 4, 5 \}}. State @math{i} denotes the fact that exactly
@math{i} disks are active; state @math{2} is absorbing. Let @math{\mu}
be the failure rate of a single disk. The system starts in state
@math{5} (all disks are operational). We use a pure death process,
with death rate from state @math{i} to state @math{i-1} is @math{\mu
i}, for @math{i = 3, 4, 5}).

The MTTF of the disk array is the MTTA of the Markov Chain, and can be
computed with the following expression:

@example
@group
@verbatiminclude @value{top_srcdir}/examples/demo_1_ctmc_mtta.m
    @result{} t = 78.333
@end group
@end example
