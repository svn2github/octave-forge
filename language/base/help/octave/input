@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} input (@var{prompt})
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {} input (@var{prompt}, "s")
Print a prompt and wait for user input.  For example,

@example
input ("Pick a number, any number! ")
@end example

@noindent
prints the prompt

@example
Pick a number, any number!
@end example

@noindent
and waits for the user to enter a value.  The string entered by the user
is evaluated as an expression, so it may be a literal constant, a
variable name, or any other valid expression.

Currently, @code{input} only returns one value, regardless of the number
of values produced by the evaluation of the expression.

If you are only interested in getting a literal string value, you can
call @code{input} with the character string @code{"s"} as the second
argument.  This tells Octave to return the string entered by the user
directly, without evaluating it first.

Because there may be output waiting to be displayed by the pager, it is
a good idea to always call @code{fflush (stdout)} before calling
@code{input}.  This will ensure that all pending output is written to
the screen before your prompt.  @xref{Input and Output}.
