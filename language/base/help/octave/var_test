@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{f}, @var{df_num}, @var{df_den}] =} var_test (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
For two samples @var{x} and @var{y} from normal distributions with
unknown means and unknown variances, perform an F-test of the null
hypothesis of equal variances.  Under the null, the test statistic
@var{f} follows an F-distribution with @var{df_num} and @var{df_den}
degrees of freedom.

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
@code{var (@var{x}) != var (@var{y})}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"},
the one-sided alternative @code{var (@var{x}) > var (@var{y})} is
used.  Similarly for "<", the one-sided alternative @code{var
(@var{x}) > var (@var{y})} is used.  The default is the two-sided
case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
