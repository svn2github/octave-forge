## @deftypefn {Function File} {} cross (@var{x}, @var{y})
## Computes the vector cross product of the two 3-dimensional vectors
## @var{x} and @var{y}.
##
## A row vector is returned if @var{x} and @var{y} are both row vectors;
## otherwise, a column vector is returned.
##
## If @var{x} and @var{y} are two - dimensional matrices the
## cross product is applied along the first dimension with 3 elements.
##
## @example
## @group
## cross ([1,1,0], [0,1,1])
##      @result{} [ 1; -1; 1 ]
## @end group
## @end example
## @end deftypefn
