@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {[@var{ofcn}, @var{odata}] =} input_event_hook (@var{fcn}, @var{data})
Given the name of a function as a string and any Octave value object,
install @var{fcn} as a function to call periodically, when Octave is
waiting for input.  The function should have the form
@example
@var{fcn} (@var{data})
@end example

If @var{data} is omitted, Octave calls the function without any
arguments.  If both @var{fcn} and @var{data} are omitted, Octave
clears the hook.  In all cases, the name of the previous hook function
and the user data are returned.
@end deftypefn
