@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{d}, @var{dd}]} = diffpara (@var{x}, @var{a}, @var{b})
Return the estimator @var{d} for the differencing parameter of an
integrated time series.

The frequencies from @math{[2*pi*a/t, 2*pi*b/T]} are used for the
estimation.  If @var{b} is omitted, the interval
@math{[2*pi/T, 2*pi*a/T]} is used.  If both @var{b} and @var{a} are
omitted then @math{a = 0.5 * sqrt (T)} and @math{b = 1.5 * sqrt (T)}
is used, where @math{T} is the sample size.  If @var{x} is a matrix,
the differencing parameter of each column is estimated.

The estimators for all frequencies in the intervals
described above is returned in @var{dd}.  The value of @var{d} is
simply the mean of @var{dd}.
