%TRANSFORMS2D Description of functions operating on transforms
%
%   By 'transform' we mean an affine transform. A planar affine transform
%   can be represented by a 3x3 matrix.
%
%   Example
%   % create a translation by the vector [10 20]:
%   T = createTranslation([10 20])
%   T =
%        1     0    10
%        0     1    20
%        0     0     1
%
