@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{tsq}] =} hotelling_test (@var{x}, @var{m})
For a sample @var{x} from a multivariate normal distribution with unknown
mean and covariance matrix, test the null hypothesis that @code{mean
(@var{x}) == @var{m}}.

Hotelling's T^2 is returned in @var{tsq}.  Under the null,
@math{(n-p) T^2 / (p(n-1))} has an F distribution with @math{p} and
@math{n-p} degrees of freedom, where @math{n} and @math{p} are the
numbers of samples and variables, respectively.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
