@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{s} =} spalloc (@var{r}, @var{c}, @var{nz})
Returns an empty sparse matrix of size @var{r}-by-@var{c}. As Octave
resizes sparse matrices at the first opportunity, so that no additional 
space is needed, the argument @var{nz} is ignored. This function is 
provided only for compatibility reasons.

It should be noted that this means that code like

@example
k = 5;
nz = r * k;
s = spalloc (r, c, nz)
for j = 1:c
  idx = randperm (r);
  s (:, j) = [zeros(r - k, 1); rand(k, 1)] (idx);
endfor
@end example

will reallocate memory at each step. It is therefore vitally important
that code like this is vectorized as much as possible.
