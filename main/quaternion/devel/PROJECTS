Quaternion PROJECTS                                       -*- text -*-
===================

grep FIXME and/or TODO for more information


-------
General:
-------
  
  * See if LaTEX code from Scottedward Hodel's quaternion.ps document is available.
    Update it to use the commands from quaternion-2.0.0.

  * Secret Wish: Reimplement package completely in C++ similar to the sparsersb package ;-)
    
--------
Features:
--------
  
  * Implement mpower.
  
  * Inverses of quaternion arrays.
  
  * Add functionality of qderiv and qtrans from quaternion-1.0.0.

------
Always:
------

  * Squash bugs.

  * Write/improve documentation.  If you implement a feature without documentation,
    nobody besides you will ever use it!  Don't waste your time :-)
 
  * Add description of each input and output argument to texinfo strings of
    functions on the INDEX list.

  * Add tests.

  * Test the quaternion package on different platforms.

  * Compare results to those from other toolboxes like QTFM.
