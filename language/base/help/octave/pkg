@deftypefn  {Command} pkg @var{command} @var{pkg_name}
@deftypefnx {Command} pkg @var{command} @var{option} @var{pkg_name}
This command interacts with the package manager. Different actions will
be taking depending on the value of @var{command}.

@table @samp
@item install
Install named packages.  For example,
@example
pkg install image-1.0.0.tar.gz
@end example
@noindent
installs the package found in the file @code{image-1.0.0.tar.gz}.

If @var{option} is @code{-nodeps} the package manager will disable the
dependency checking. That way it is possible to install a package even
if it depends on another package that's not installed on the system.
@strong{Use this option with care.}

If @var{option} is @code{-noauto} the package manager will not
automatically load the installed package when starting Octave,
even if the package requests that it is.

If @var{option} is @code{-auto} the package manager will
automatically load the installed package when starting Octave,
even if the package requests that it isn't.
@item uninstall
Uninstall named packages.  For example,
@example
pkg uninstall image
@end example
@noindent
removes the @code{image} package from the system. If another installed
package depends on the @code{image} package an error will be issued.
The package can be uninstalled anyway by using the @code{-nodeps} option.
@item load
Add named packages to the path. After loading a package it is
possible to use the functions provided by the package. For example,
@example
pkg load image
@end example
@noindent
adds the @code{image} package to the path. It is possible to load all
installed packages at once with the command
@example
pkg load all
@end example
@item unload
Removes named packages from the path. After unloading a package it is
no longer possible to use the functions provided by the package.
This command behaves like the @code{load} command.
@item list
Show a list of the currently installed packages. By requesting one or two
output argument it is possible to get a list of the currently installed
packages. For example,
@example
installed_packages = pkg list;
@end example
@noindent
returns a cell array containing a structure for each installed package.
The command
@example
[@var{user_packages}, @var{system_packages}] = pkg list
@end example
@noindent
splits the list of installed packages into those who are installed by
the current user, and those installed by the system administrator.
@item prefix
Set the installation prefix directory. For example,
@example
pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages
@end example
@noindent
sets the installation prefix to @code{~/my_octave_packages}.
Packages will be installed in this directory.

It is possible to get the current installation prefix by requesting an
output argument.  For example,
@example
p = pkg prefix
@end example
@item local_list
Set the file in which to look for information on the locally
installed packages. Locally installed packages are those that are
typically available only to the current user. For example
@example
pkg local_list ~/.octave_packages
@end example
It is possible to get the current value of local_list with the following
@example
pkg local_list
@end example
@item global_list
Set the file in which to look for, for information on the globally
installed packages. Globally installed packages are those that are
typically available to all users. For example
@example
pkg global_list /usr/share/octave/octave_packages
@end example
It is possible to get the current value of global_list with the following
@example
pkg global_list
@end example
@end table
@end deftypefn
