@deftypefn {Command} compare_versions(@var{v1}, @var{v2}, @var{operator})
Compares to version strings using the given @var{operator}.

This function assumes that versions @var{v1} and @var{v2} are
arbitrarily long strings made of numeric and period characters
possibly followed by an arbitrary string (e.g. "1.2.3", "0.3",
"0.1.2+", or "1.2.3.4-test1").

The version is first split into the numeric and the character parts
then the parts are padded to be the same length (i.e. "1.1" would be
padded to be like "1.1.0" when being compared with "1.1.1", and
separately, the character parts of the strings are padded with
nulls).

The operator can be any logical operator from the set

@itemize @bullet
@item
"=="
equal
@item
"<"
less than
@item
"<="
less than or equal to
@item
">"
greater than
@item
">="
greater than or equal to
@item
"!="
not equal
@item
"~="
not equal
@end itemize

Note that version "1.1-test2" would compare as greater than
"1.1-test10". Also, since the numeric part is compared first, "a"
compares less than "1a" because the second string starts with a
numeric part even though double("a") is greater than double("1").
