@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{chisq}, @var{df}] =} mcnemar_test (@var{x})
For a square contingency table @var{x} of data cross-classified on
the row and column variables, McNemar's test can be used for testing
the null hypothesis of symmetry of the classification probabilities.

Under the null, @var{chisq} is approximately distributed as chisquare
with @var{df} degrees of freedom.

The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{chisq}) is
returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
