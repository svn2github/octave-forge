@deftypefn {Function File} {} polyarea (@var{x}, @var{y})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} polyarea (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{dim})

Determines area of a polygon by triangle method. The variables
@var{x} and @var{y} define the vertex pairs, and must therefore have
the same shape. They can be either vectors or arrays. If they are
arrays then the columns of @var{x} and @var{y} are treated separately
and an area returned for each.

If the optional @var{dim} argument is given, then @code{polyarea}
works along this dimension of the arrays @var{x} and @var{y}.
