grep FIXME and/or TODO for more information


-------
General:
-------

  * Multiplot feature for time and frequency response functions.
    sigma (sys1, sys2, ...), step (sys1, "b", sys2, "r", ...)

  * Improve c2d, e.g. "tustin" option.

  * Implement d2c.

  * Improve @lti/subsasgn.m

  * Improve @lti/parallel.m

  * n-th order approximation of time delay  exp (tau*s)
    sys = pade (tau, n)

  * Add delays  exp (-T*s)  indelay, outdelay, stdelay, ...
    -- Support time and frequency responses.
    -- Support interconnections.

  * Implement zpk models and @zpset similar to @tfpoly.

  * SLICOT model and controller reduction.  Separate control-reduction package?

  * SLICOT system identification.  Separate control-identification package?

  * Check whether RASP-DESCRIPT Fortran routines are free software and include them
    for dss system conversions and other stuff if possible.

  * Add input and output groups to LTI models.
    -- sys.ingroup.controls = [1, 3] (stored as a struct)
    -- sys(:, "controls") (instead of sys(:, [1, 3]))
    -- Handle __sys_group__ case when indices of the second lti need to be increased
       by the size of the first lti.
    -- Handle __sys_prune__ case when indices need to be deleted from all struct fields
       and channels numbers after the deleted ones need to be decreased.
    -- Handle conflicting names for __sys_group__.
    -- Beware of indices not in ascending order.

-----------------------
Frequency Response Data:
-----------------------

  * Tolerances for intersection of frequency vectors in @frd/__sys_group__.m

------------------
State-Space Models:
------------------

  * Balancing: TB01TD ?

------------------------
Transfer Function Models:
------------------------

  * Support "z^-1" as tfvar (@tf and @tfpoly)

  * MIMO tf interconnections (@tf/__sys_connect__.m)

  * Use SLICOT (TD04AD?) for tf2ss conversion (@tf/__sys2ss__.m)

  * Implement c2d conversion (@tf/__c2d__.m)

------
Always:
------

  * Squash bugs.

  * Write/improve documentation.  If you implement a feature without documentation,
    nobody besides you will ever use it!  Don't waste your time :-)
 
  * Add description of each input and output argument to texinfo strings of
    functions on the INDEX list.

  * Add tests.

  * Test the control package on different platforms.

  * Compare results to those from other free and non-free implementations of an
    Octave-like language.
