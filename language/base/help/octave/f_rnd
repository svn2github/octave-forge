@deftypefnx {Function File} {} f_rnd (@var{m}, @var{n}, @var{sz})
Return an @var{r} by @var{c} matrix of random samples from the F
distribution with @var{m} and @var{n} degrees of freedom.  Both
@var{m} and @var{n} must be scalar or of size @var{r} by @var{c}.
If @var{sz} is a vector the random samples are in a matrix of 
size @var{sz}.

If @var{r} and @var{c} are omitted, the size of the result matrix is
the common size of @var{m} and @var{n}.
