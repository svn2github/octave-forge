@deffn {Command} save options file @var{v1} @var{v2} @dots{}
Save the named variables @var{v1}, @var{v2}, @dots{} in the file
@var{file}.  The special filename @samp{-} can be used to write the
output to your terminal.  If no variable names are listed, Octave saves
all the variables in the current scope.  Valid options for the
@code{save} command are listed in the following table.  Options that
modify the output format override the format specified by
@code{default_save_options}.

If save is invoked using the functional form

@example
save ("-text", "file.txt", "a")
@end example

@noindent
then the @var{options}, @var{file}, and variable name arguments
(@var{vname1}, @dots{}) must be specified as character strings.

@table @code
@item -ascii
Save a single matrix in a text file.

@item -binary
Save the data in Octave's binary data format.

@item -float-binary
Save the data in Octave's binary data format but only using single
precision.  You should use this format only if you know that all the
values to be saved can be represented in single precision.

@item -V7
@itemx -v7
@itemx -7
@itemx -mat7-binary
Save the data in @sc{Matlab}'s v7 binary data format.

@item -V6
@itemx -v6
@itemx -6
@itemx -mat
@itemx -mat-binary
Save the data in @sc{Matlab}'s v6 binary data format.

@item -V4
@itemx -v4
@itemx -4
@itemx -mat4-binary
Save the data in the binary format written by @sc{Matlab} version 4.

@item -hdf5
Save the data in HDF5 format.
(HDF5 is a free, portable binary format developed by the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.)

HDF5 load and save are not available, as this Octave executable was
not linked with the HDF5 library.
@item -float-hdf5
Save the data in HDF5 format but only using single precision.
You should use this format only if you know that all the
values to be saved can be represented in single precision.

@item -zip
@itemx -z
Use the gzip algorithm to compress the file. This works equally on files that
are compressed with gzip outside of octave, and gzip can equally be used to
convert the files for backward compatibility.
@end table

The list of variables to save may include wildcard patterns containing
the following special characters:
@table @code
@item ?
Match any single character.

@item *
Match zero or more characters.

@item [ @var{list} ]
Match the list of characters specified by @var{list}.  If the first
character is @code{!} or @code{^}, match all characters except those
specified by @var{list}.  For example, the pattern @samp{[a-zA-Z]} will
match all lower and upper case alphabetic characters. 

@item -text
Save the data in Octave's text data format.
@end table

Except when using the @sc{Matlab} binary data file format, saving global
variables also saves the global status of the variable, so that if it is
restored at a later time using @samp{load}, it will be restored as a
global variable.

The command

@example
save -binary data a b*
@end example

@noindent
saves the variable @samp{a} and all variables beginning with @samp{b} to
the file @file{data} in Octave's binary format.
@end deffn
