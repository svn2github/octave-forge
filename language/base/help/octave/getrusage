@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} getrusage ()
Return a structure containing a number of statistics about the current
Octave process.  Not all fields are available on all systems.  If it is
not possible to get CPU time statistics, the CPU time slots are set to
zero.  Other missing data are replaced by NaN.  Here is a list of all
the possible fields that can be present in the structure returned by
@code{getrusage}:

@table @code
@item idrss
Unshared data size.

@item inblock
Number of block input operations.

@item isrss
Unshared stack size.

@item ixrss
Shared memory size.

@item majflt
Number of major page faults.

@item maxrss
Maximum data size.

@item minflt
Number of minor page faults.

@item msgrcv
Number of messages received.

@item msgsnd
Number of messages sent.

@item nivcsw
Number of involuntary context switches.

@item nsignals
Number of signals received.

@item nswap
Number of swaps.

@item nvcsw
Number of voluntary context switches.

@item oublock
Number of block output operations.

@item stime
A structure containing the system CPU time used.  The structure has the
elements @code{sec} (seconds) @code{usec} (microseconds).

@item utime
