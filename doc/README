This directory contains documentation about octave in general.  Documentation
for specific packages should go in the individual package directories.

New documents must be referenced from index.html

To access the document from the octave.sf.net home page, upload it as
follows:

  scp file.html user@octave.sf.net:/home/groups/o/oc/octave/htdocs

If this is a new document, then you will need to reference it from 
octave.sf home page and make the file group writable:

  ssh -l user octave.sf.net
  cd /home/groups/o/oc/octave/htdocs
  vi index.html
  chmod g+w file.html
