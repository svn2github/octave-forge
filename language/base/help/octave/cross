@deftypefn {Function File} {} cross (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{dim})
Computes the vector cross product of the two 3-dimensional vectors
@var{x} and @var{y}.

@example
@group
cross ([1,1,0], [0,1,1])
@result{} [ 1; -1; 1 ]
@end group
@end example

If @var{x} and @var{y} are matrices, the cross product is applied 
along the first dimension with 3 elements. The optional argument 
@var{dim} is used to force the cross product to be calculated along
the dimension defined by @var{dim}.
