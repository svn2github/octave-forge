@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} diag (@var{v}, @var{k})
Return a diagonal matrix with vector @var{v} on diagonal @var{k}.  The
second argument is optional.  If it is positive, the vector is placed on
the @var{k}-th super-diagonal.  If it is negative, it is placed on the
@var{-k}-th sub-diagonal.  The default value of @var{k} is 0, and the
vector is placed on the main diagonal.  For example,

@example
@group
diag ([1, 2, 3], 1)
     @result{}  0  1  0  0
         0  0  2  0
         0  0  0  3
         0  0  0  0
