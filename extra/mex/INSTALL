To use mex, first compile the mex.cc support library.

a.) If you are using the octaveSF package, then you won't
    need to do anything---it was compiled and installed when you
    compiled and installed octaveSF.  
    
b.) If you are using mex with octave 2.0.x, edit the Makefile and
    replace 'mkoctfile' with 'mkoctfile -DHAVE_OCTAVE_20'.
   
c.) Type make to build mex.so and mex

d.) To test mex in place, use e.g.,
	./mex mystruct.c
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd` octave
    	> mystruct(struct('s',{1,2},'t',3))

d.) Move mex to your executable path (e.g., ~/bin) and mex.1 to your
    man path and you are done
