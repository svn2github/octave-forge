## @deftypefnx {Function File} @var{xls} = xlsopen (@var{filename}, @var{readwrite}, @var{reqintf})
## Get a pointer to an Excel spreadsheet in the form of return argument
## (file pointer struct) @var{xls}. After processing the spreadsheet,
## the file pointer must be explicitly closed by calling xlsclose().
##
## Calling xlsopen without specifying a return argument is fairly useless!
##
## xlsopen works with interfaces, which are links to external software.
## For reading from OOXML (Excel 2007 and up), ODS 1.2 and Gnumeric no
## additional software is required when the OCT interface is used. For all
## other spreadsheet formats and for writing to spreadsheet files, you need
## MS-Excel (95 - 2013), or a Java JRE plus Apache POI >= 3.5 and/or JExcelAPI
## and/or OpenXLS and/or OpenOffice.org (or clones) installed on your computer
## + proper javaclasspath set. These interfaces are referred to as COM, POI,
## JXL, OXS, and UNO, resp., and are preferred in that order by default
## (depending on their presence). The OCT interface has the lowest priority.
## For OOXML read/write support, in addition to Apache POI support you also
## need the following jars in your javaclasspath: poi-ooxml-schemas-3.5.jar,
## xbean.jar and dom4j-1.6.1.jar (or later versions). Later OpenOffice.org
## versions (UNO interface) have support for OOXML as well.
## Excel'95 spreadsheets can only be read by JExcelAPI and OpenOffice.org.
## For just reading OOXML (.xlsx or .xlsm), no Java or add-on packages are 
## required; but currently you loose a bit of the flexibility of the other
## interfaces.
##
## @var{filename} should be a valid .xls or xlsx Excel file name (including
## extension). But if you use the COM interface you can specify any extension
## that your installed Excel version can read AND write; the same goes for UNO
## (OpenOffice.org). Using the other Java interfaces, only .xls or .xlsx are
## allowed. If @var{filename} does not contain any directory path, the file
## is saved in the current directory.
##
## If @var{readwrite} is set to 0 (default value) or omitted, the Excel file
## is opened for reading. If @var{readwrite} is set to True or 1, an Excel
## file is opened (or created) for reading & writing.
##
## Optional input argument @var{reqintf} can be used to override the Excel
## interface that otherwise is automatically selected by xlsopen. Currently
## implemented interfaces (in order of preference) are 'COM' (Excel/COM),
## 'POI' (Java/Apache POI), 'JXL' (Java/JExcelAPI), 'OXS' (Java/OpenXLS),
## 'UNO' (Java/OpenOffice.org - EXPERIMENTAL!), or 'OCT' (native Octave).
## In most situations this parameter is unneeded as xlsopen automatically
## selects the most useful interface present.
##
## Beware: Excel invocations may be left running invisibly in case of COM
## errors or forgetting to close the file pointer. Similarly for OpenOffice.org
## which may even prevent Octave from being closed.
##
## Examples:
##
## @example
##   xls = xlsopen ('test1.xls');
##   (get a pointer for reading from spreadsheet test1.xls)
##
##   xls = xlsopen ('test2.xls', 1, 'POI');
##   (as above, indicate test2.xls will be written to; in this case using Java
##    and the Apache POI interface are requested)
## @end example
##
## @seealso {xlsclose, xlsread, xlswrite, xls2oct, oct2xls, xlsfinfo}
##
## @end deftypefn
