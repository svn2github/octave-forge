@deffn {Command} type options name @dots{}
Display the definition of each @var{name} that refers to a function.

Normally also displays if each @var{name} is user-defined or builtin;
the @code{-q} option suppresses this behaviour.

Currently, Octave can only display functions that can be compiled
cleanly, because it uses its internal representation of the function to
recreate the program text.

Comments are not displayed because Octave's parser currently discards
them as it converts the text of a function file to its internal
representation.  This problem may be fixed in a future release.
