#  Octave functions for manipulating structures
#
#  Etienne Grossmann (etienne@isr.ist.utl.pt), 1999,2000

#  With modifications by Paul Kienzle:
#    remove cmpstruct, fields, test_struct, catstruct
#    add fieldnames
#    signal errors rather than trapping to the keyboard
#  See http://anonimo.isr.ist.utl.pt/~etienne/octave/ for the originals

#  Note: interface does not exactly match matlab
#  rmfield must be able to accept a cell array or string array of names
#  struct/getfield/setfield must be able to handle arrays of structures 
#     (not possible since octave doesn't handle arrays of structures)
#  fieldnames must return a cell array 
#     (not possible since octave doesn't handle cell arrays)
#  struct2cell missing
#     (not possible since octave doesn't handle cell arrays)
#  isfield added
#     (how do you do this in Matlab?)
