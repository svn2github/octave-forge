How to update the database of constant values.
----------------------------------------------

The database of constant values is stored in the ASCII file

 inst/private/octave_physical_constants_data.m

to update this file when an update to the CODATA constants 
is issued, one should:

1) download the full list of constants as an ASCII file from 
   http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/Table/allascii.txt

2) edit the file manually so that it will construct a cell array
   of strings named ccell
