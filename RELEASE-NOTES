Now requires octave-2.1.43 to work correctly.  
Some functions may work with older versions of Octave.  
Use make -k to build whatever can be built ignoring the rest.

2003-02-?? for Octave 2.1.43 =================================================

* Updates for octave 2.1.43

* Parallel: Light weight parallel programming paradigm added to main, but
  flagged NOINSTALL.

* Communications: add galois field functions

* Signal Processing: add convmtx and dftmtx

* Geometry: add (poor) griddata/tsearch support --- please improve!!

* VRML: new options 'z(grey|rb|col)' for vmesh() and
  vrml_surf(). Fixes and improvements to many functions.

* NaN:

* TSA:

* Sparse: add spstats and x.^a, more robust

* Base functions: add fileparts, filesep, char, dos; improve dlmread

* Function overloading: dispatch() lets you call tf rather than f if the
  first argument to f is t.

* Octave server: listen() sets up a socket to receive octave commands from
  a particular host --- please improve!!

Many fixes, compatibility improvements and better Windows support.

Thanks, all!

2002-05-09 for Octave 2.1.31 =================================================

This is a bug fix release.  Many thanks to the good folks at Debian for
finding the portability problems.

New functions

	* miscellaneous/OCTAVE_FORGE_VERSION
	* extra/tsa/durlev
	* strings/base64encode
	* signal/guasswin
	* image/colfilt

Changes

	* audio/sound: uses ssh rather than rsh for remote audio

	* now compiles on most Debian systems which support Octave.
	* updated doc strings, tests

Administration

	* make check and make icheck added.  Only supports the compiled
	  functions at the moment, but it is a start.
