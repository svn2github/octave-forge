@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} fflush (@var{fid})
Flush output to @var{fid}.  This is useful for ensuring that all
pending output makes it to the screen before some other event occurs.
For example, it is always a good idea to flush the standard output
stream before calling @code{input}.

@code{fflush} returns 0 on success and an OS dependent error value
(@minus{}1 on unix) on error.
