@deffn {Command} clear [-x] pattern @dots{}
Delete the names matching the given patterns from the symbol table.  The
pattern may contain the following special characters:

@table @code
@item ?
Match any single character.

@item *
Match zero or more characters.

@item [ @var{list} ]
Match the list of characters specified by @var{list}.  If the first
character is @code{!} or @code{^}, match all characters except those
specified by @var{list}.  For example, the pattern @samp{[a-zA-Z]} will
match all lower and upper case alphabetic characters.
@end table

For example, the command

@example
clear foo b*r
@end example

@noindent
clears the name @code{foo} and all names that begin with the letter
@code{b} and end with the letter @code{r}.

If @code{clear} is called without any arguments, all user-defined
variables (local and global) are cleared from the symbol table.  If
@code{clear} is called with at least one argument, only the visible
names matching the arguments are cleared.  For example, suppose you have
defined a function @code{foo}, and then hidden it by performing the
assignment @code{foo = 2}.  Executing the command @kbd{clear foo} once
will clear the variable definition and restore the definition of
@code{foo} as a function.  Executing @kbd{clear foo} a second time will
clear the function definition.

With -x, clear the variables that don't match the patterns.

This command may not be used within a function body.
@end deffn
