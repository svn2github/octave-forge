@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} vr_val (@var{x})
Each time this function is called, it places the value of its argument
at the end of the list of values to return from the current
function.  Once @code{vr_val} has been called, there is no way to go
back to the beginning of the list and rewrite any of the return
values.  This function may only be called within functions that have
been declared to return an unspecified number of output arguments.
@end deftypefn
