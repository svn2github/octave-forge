Summary of important user-visible changes for queueing-1.X.0

** Function ctmc_exps() can now compute the expected sojourn time
   until absorption for absorming CTMC

** Functions ctmc_exps() and ctmc_taexps() now accept a scalar as
   the second argument (time). The old syntax is still supported,
   but may be deprecated in the future.

   of the birth-death process with given rates, not the steady-state
   solution.

** New function dtmc_bd() added
