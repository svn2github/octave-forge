@deftypefn {Function File} {} mean (@var{x}, @var{dim}, @var{opt})
If @var{x} is a vector, compute the mean of the elements of @var{x}
@iftex
@tex
$$ {\rm mean}(x) = \bar{x} = {1\over N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i $$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo

@example
mean (x) = SUM_i x(i) / N
@end example
@end ifinfo
If @var{x} is a matrix, compute the mean for each column and return them
in a row vector.

With the optional argument @var{opt}, the kind of mean computed can be
selected.  The following options are recognized:

@table @code
@item "a"
Compute the (ordinary) arithmetic mean.  This is the default.

@item "g"
Compute the geometric mean.

@item "h"
Compute the harmonic mean.
@end table

If the optional argument @var{dim} is supplied, work along dimension
@var{dim}.

Both @var{dim} and @var{opt} are optional.  If both are supplied,
either may appear first.
@end deftypefn
