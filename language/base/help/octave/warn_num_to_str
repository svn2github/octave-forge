@defvr {Built-in Variable} warn_num_to_str
If the value of @code{warn_num_to_str} is nonzero, a warning is
printed for implicit conversions of numbers to their ASCII character
equivalents when strings are constructed using a mixture of strings and
numbers in matrix notation.  For example,

@example
@group
[ "f", 111, 111 ]
     @result{} "foo"
@end group
@end example
elicits a warning if @code{warn_num_to_str} is nonzero.  The default
value is 1.
