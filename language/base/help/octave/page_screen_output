@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {@var{val} =} page_screen_output ()
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {@var{old_val} =} page_screen_output (@var{new_val})
Query or set the internal variable that controls whether output intended
for the terminal window that is longer than one page is sent through a
pager.  This allows you to view one screenful at a time.  Some pagers
(such as @code{less}---see @ref{Installation}) are also capable of moving
backward on the output.
