@deftypefn {Function File} {} orth (@var{a}, @var{tol})
Return an orthonormal basis of the range space of @var{a}.

The dimension of the range space is taken as the number of singular
values of @var{a} greater than @var{tol}.  If the argument @var{tol} is
missing, it is computed as

@example
max (size (@var{a})) * max (svd (@var{a})) * eps
@end example
@end deftypefn
