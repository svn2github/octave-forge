@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} splice (@var{list_1}, @var{offset}, @var{length}, @var{list_2})
Replace @var{length} elements of @var{list_1} beginning at
@var{offset} with the contents of @var{list_2} (if any).  If
@var{length} is omitted, all elements from @var{offset} to the end of
@var{list_1} are replaced.  As a special case, if @var{offset} is one
greater than the length of @var{list_1} and @var{length} is 0, splice
is equivalent to @code{append (@var{list_1}, @var{list_2})}.
@end deftypefn
