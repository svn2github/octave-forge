Code stolen in large part from Python's, listobject.c, which itself had
no license header. However, thanks to Tim Peters for the parts of the
code I ripped-off.

As required in the Python license the short description of the changes
made are

* convert the sorting code in listobject.cc into a generic class, 
  replacing PyObject* with the type of the class T.

The Python license is

  PSF LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR PYTHON 2.3
