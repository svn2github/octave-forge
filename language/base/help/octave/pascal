@deftypefn {Function File} {} pascal (@var{n}, @var{t})

Return the Pascal matrix of order @var{n} if @code{@var{t} = 0}.
@var{t} defaults to 0. Return lower triangular Cholesky factor of 
the Pascal matrix if @code{@var{t} = 1}. This matrix is its own
inverse, that is @code{pascal (@var{n}, 1) ^ 2 == eye (@var{n})}.
If @code{@var{t} = 2}, return a transposed and  permuted version of
@code{pascal (@var{n}, 1)}, which is the cube-root of the identity
matrix. That is @code{pascal (@var{n}, 2) ^ 3 == eye (@var{n})}.
