Calculates the discrete Laplace operator. If @var{m} is a matrix this is
defined as

@iftex
@tex
$d = {1 \over 4} \left( {d^2 \over dx^2} M(x,y) + {d^2 \over dy^2} M(x,y) \right)$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@example
@group
      1    / d^2            d^2         \
D  = --- * | ---  M(x,y) +  ---  M(x,y) | 
      4    \ dx^2           dy^2        /
@end group
@end example
@end ifnottex

The above to continued to N-dimensional arrays calculating the second
derivative over the higher dimensions.

The spacing between evaluation points may be defined by @var{h}, which is a
scalar defining the spacing in all dimensions. Or alternative, the spacing
in each dimension may be defined separately by @var{dx}, @var{dy}, etc. 
Scalar spacing values give equidistant spacing, whereas vector spacing 
values can be used to specify variable spacing. The length of the vectors
must match the respective dimension of @var{m}. The default spacing value
is 1.

You need at least 3 data points for each dimension. Boundary points are
calculated as the linear extrapolation of the interior points.
