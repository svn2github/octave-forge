Package: ATLAS
Version: 3.6.0
Home page: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
Download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/math-atlas
License: BSD

Compilation: from Cygwin shell with VS environment + ar-msvc + cc-msvc + build_atlas_dll

Requirements: ar-msvc, cc-msvc(*), lapack(*), build_atlas_dll(*)

Note: install the ATLAS source package in a directory without
      spaces in it. The build process does not handle spaces
      in directories correctly

1) Apply the patch

2) make xconfig

3) ./xconfig -c mvc

   Answer the questions with the following specific answers
   (this does not represent all answers, but only the specific
   answers for MSVC compilation; the other answers are left to
   the user)

	. disable posix threads
	. rebuild ATLwin_vc.exe
		- specify the correct path for cl.exe
	. do not use express setup
	. Library name for ATLAS primitives => libatlas.lib
	. Library name C interface to BLAS => libcblas.lib
	. Library name F77 interface to BLAS => libf77blas.lib
	. Enter C Flags (CCFLAGS) => add "-MD" to the existing flags
	. Enter Archiver => ar-msvc
	. Enter Archiver flags => --cygwin r

4) Edit the generated file Make.<your_arch> (where <your_arch> is
   the name of your architecture in ATLAS build process, for instance
   WinNT_P4SSE2) and change the following variables:

	. LAPACKlib: liblapack.a => liblapack.lib
	. TESTlib: libtstatlas.a => libtstatlas.lib

5) make install arch=<your_arch>

   During compilation process, avoid using your computer to get
   correct timing results.

If you want to build ATLAS-based BLAS/LAPACK replacement DLL's

6) Enter lib\<your_arch> subdirectory

7) build_atlas_dll

8) Install (copy manually):
	. blas.dll and lapack.dll into bin directory
	. blas.lib and lapack.lib into lib directory

(*) These dependencies are required if you want to build ATLAS-based
    BLAS/LAPACK replacement DLL's
