@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{chisq}, @var{df}] =} chisquare_test_independence (@var{x})
Perform a chi-square test for independence based on the contingency
table @var{x}.  Under the null hypothesis of independence,
@var{chisq} approximately has a chi-square distribution with
@var{df} degrees of freedom.

The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at chisq) of the
test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.
