@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{k}, @var{df}] =} kruskal_wallis_test (@var{x1}, @dots{})
Perform a Kruskal-Wallis one-factor "analysis of variance".

Suppose a variable is observed for @var{k} > 1 different groups, and
let @var{x1}, @dots{}, @var{xk} be the corresponding data vectors.

Under the null hypothesis that the ranks in the pooled sample are not
affected by the group memberships, the test statistic @var{k} is
approximately chi-square with @var{df} = @var{k} - 1 degrees of
freedom.

The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{k}) is
returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.
