@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{a}, @var{b}, @var{c}, @var{d}] =} tf2ss (@var{num}, @var{den})
Conversion from transfer function to state-space.
The state space system:
@iftex
@tex
$$ \dot x = Ax + Bu $$
$$ y = Cx + Du $$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@example
      .
      x = Ax + Bu
      y = Cx + Du
@end example
@end ifinfo
is obtained from a transfer function:
@iftex
@tex
$$ G(s) = { { \rm num }(s) \over { \rm den }(s) } $$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@example
                num(s)
          G(s)=-------
                den(s)
@end example
@end ifinfo

The vector @var{den} must contain only one row, whereas the vector 
@var{num} may contain as many rows as there are outputs @var{y} of 
the system. The state space system matrices obtained from this function 
will be in controllable canonical form as described in @cite{Modern Control 
Theory}, (Brogan, 1991).
