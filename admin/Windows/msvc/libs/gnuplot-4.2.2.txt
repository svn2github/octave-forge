1) Apply the patch

2) Edit config\makefile.nt and adapt the following variables:
	. DESTDIR : the installation directory
	. WXLOCATION : the wxWidgets source tree location
	. VCLIBS_ROOT : the installation directory of support
	  libraries (cairo, pango...)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

(*) wxWidgets package should have been built and the source tree
    left in place

(**) The build of wgnuplot.hlp file has been disabled, because it
     require MS Help Workshop installed, which is rarely the case.
     The easiest is to grab the file from a pre-built binary on the
     web and put it into the same directory as the gnuplot executables.
