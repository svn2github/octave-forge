@deftypefn {Function File} {} dir (@var{directory})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{list}] =} dir (@var{directory})
Display file listing for directory @var{directory}.  If a return
value is requested, return a structure array with the fields

@example
@group
name
bytes
date
isdir
statinfo
@end group
@end example

@noindent
in which @code{statinfo} is the structure returned from @code{stat}.

If @var{directory} is not a directory, return information about the
named @var{filename}.  @var{directory} may be a list of directories
specified either by name or with wildcard characters (like * and ?)
which will be expanded with glob.

Note that for symbolic links, @code{dir} returns information about
the file that a symbolic link points to instead of the link itself.
However, if the link points to a nonexistent file, @code{dir} returns
information about the link.
