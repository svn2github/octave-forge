Octave-mingw64 crossgcc
=======================

This directory contains a minimal environment to build x86 and/or 
x64 targetted GNU gcc toolchain based on the mingw-w64 CRT 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/).
The gcc build makefile is based on and inspierd by the mingw-w64 project's 
makefile available at
https://mingw-w64.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mingw-w64/experimental/buildsystem/makebuildroot.mk
and
https://mingw-w64.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mingw-w64/experimental/buildsystem/makebuildroot-test.mk
Credit to the mingw-w64 project for providing these.

Msys installer
==============

To build the gcc toolchain a proper msys environment is required, along with
a win32-based gcc compiler.
The script in msysinstaller/install.cmd acts as a mini-installer which fetches
the necessary msys binaries from the mingw SF project page at 
http://sourceforge.net/project/mingw and installs it to a location specified by
the caller.
Additionally it installs the mingw32 gcc also available from the mingw project
and makes it available to the msys environment.

Usage
=====

The msys installer script requires that you have the following executables
*prior* to installing msys available in your PATH:

  *) basic-bsdtar.exe available from the mingw project at
     http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/basic-bsdtar-2.8.3-1-mingw32-bin.zip
     Download it, unzip, and place in your PATH (or the directory the installer 
     script resides)
     
  *) wget.exe available e.g. from 
     http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/cgi-bin/fetch.pl?dl=wget/wget.exe

Call install.cmd and specify the directory you want MSYS installed to.
Preferably use an installation path without spaces.

The gcc toolchain can then be built from within msys by simply calling
   make all
By default, a 32bit hosted gcc tagetting the i686-w64-mingw32 platform is built.
To change the target platform specify 
   make TARGET_ARCH=x86_64-w64-mingw32 all
You might also want to change the default MAKE_PARALLEL of "-j4" to a value 
appropriate to your build machine.
