@deftypefn {Function File} {} hygecdf (@var{x}, @var{m}, @var{t}, @var{n})
Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at @var{x} of the
hypergeometric distribution with parameters @var{m}, @var{t}, and
@var{n}.  This is the probability of obtaining not more than @var{x}
marked items when randomly drawing a sample of size @var{n} without
replacement from a population of total size @var{t} containing
@var{m} marked items.

The parameters @var{m}, @var{t}, and @var{n} must positive integers
with @var{m} and @var{n} not greater than @var{t}.
