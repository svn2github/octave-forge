@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {[@var{x}, @var{rcond}] = } spinv (@var{a}, @var{Q})
Compute the inverse of the sparse square matrix @var{a}.  Return an estimate
of the reciprocal condition number if requested, otherwise warn of an
ill-conditioned matrix if the reciprocal condition number is small.
This function takes advantage of the sparsity of the matrix to accelerate
the calculation of the inverse.

In general @var{x} will be a full matrix, and so if possible forming the
inverse of a sparse matrix should be avoided. It is significantly more
accurate and faster to do @code{@var{y} = @var{a} \ @var{b}}, rather
than @code{@var{y} = spinv (@var{a}) * @var{b}}.
