@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{r}, @var{k}] =} rref (@var{a}, @var{tol})

Returns the reduced row echelon form of @var{a}. @var{tol} defaults
to @code{eps * max (size (@var{a})) * norm (@var{a}, inf)}.

Called with two return arguments, @var{k} returns the vector of
"bound variables", which are those columns on which elimination 
has been performed.
