@deftypefn {Function File} {} qderivmat (@var{omega})
Derivative of a quaternion.

Let Q be a quaternion to transform a vector from a fixed frame to
a rotating frame.  If the rotating frame is rotating about the 
[x, y, z] axes at angular rates [wx, wy, wz], then the derivative
of Q is given by

@example
Q' = qderivmat (omega) * Q
@end example

If the passive convention is used (rotate the frame, not the vector),
then

@example
Q' = -qderivmat (omega) * Q.
@end example
@end deftypefn
