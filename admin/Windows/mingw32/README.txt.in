This package has been built against the @OCTAVE_VERSION@ version of Octave 
available from http://www.octave.org.
It has been built using revision @BUILD_REVISION@ of the building scripts 
hosted at http://octave.sourceforge.net.

This version of Octave has many new features relative to previous versions, 
including:

  * Compatibility with Matlab graphics has been improved.
  * New experimental OpenGL/FLTK based plotting system.
  * Improvements to the debugger.
  * Improved traceback error messages.
  * Object Oriented Programming.
  * Block comments.
  * Single Precision data type.
  * 64-bit integer arithmetic.
  * New functions for reading and writing images.

and the file CHANGELOG.txt in your local installation root.

and the KNOWN_ISSUES.txt file in your local installation root.

Installing Octave:
------------------

It is highly recommended to install Octave to a path WITHOUT spaces. 
Octave will work if installed to a path including spaces, and all packages 
added at the installation will work if installed into a path containing spaces,
HOWEVER you will currently NOT be able to install packages using octave's
package manager at a later time if Octave was installed to a directory 
containing spaces.

Using this package for the development of OCT and MEX files:
-----------------------------------------------------------

This package is bundled with the compiler used to compile this package.
This version of the package has been compiled with TDM's port of GCC/mingw32
using GCC version @GCC_VERSION@.
The compiler is available from

http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc/

OCT files can be compiled from the Octave prompt with the "mkoctfile"
command, whereas as MEX files can be compiled with the "mex" command.

Contributing to Octave:
----------------------

There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make Octave
a better system. Perhaps the most important way to contribute is to
write high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make your
code freely available for others to use. For inspiration, we have a
wish-list of projects (http://www.octave.org/projects.html) and
feature requests.

If you've written a useful function for Octave that you would like to
make available for others to use, please post it to the sources
mailing list (sources@octave.org). Messages sent to this list will be
seen by the Octave maintainers, and will be considered for inclusion
in future releases of Octave. The messages are also archived
(http://www.octave.org/archive.org) , so even if the code is not
included in a future release, it will remain available for others to
use.

If you find Octave useful, consider providing additional funding
(http://www.octave.org/funding.html) to continue its development. Even
a modest amount of additional funding could make a significant
difference in the amount of time that its author can devote to
development and support.

If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still help
make Octave better and more reliable by reporting any bugs
(http://www.octave.org/bugs.html) you find and by offering suggestions
for ways to improve Octave.

Octave-Forge Packages
---------------------

This package is also bundled with a minimum MSYS environment required for
octave's package manager. Provided that the dependencies are met, octave-forge
packages can be installed from the octave prompt with the "pkg" command.

MIND that package installation is currently only possible if Octave is 
installed to a directory WITHOUT spaces!

This package is bundled with the binaries & development files of external
libraries allowing the build of the following octave-forge packages:
