This is a multipackage, therefore it is organized in subfolders.

When adding a new subproject with a src folder, make sure to provide a unique makefile
merged with the previous one. The installation scripts doesn't hanlde multiple Makefiles yet.

You will need to edit pre_install as well...

I will fix this asap. If you have ideas please send me an e-mail.
