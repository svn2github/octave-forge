## @deftypefn {Function File} [@var{xls}] = xlsclose (@var{xls})
## @deftypefnx {Function File} [@var{xls}] = xlsclose (@var{xls}, @var{filename})
## @deftypefnx {Function File} [@var{xls}] = xlsclose (@var{xls}, "FORCE")
## Close the Excel spreadsheet pointed to in struct @var{xls}, if needed
## write the file to disk. Based on information contained in @var{xls},
## xlsclose will determine if the file should be written to disk.
##
## If no errors occured during writing, the xls file pointer struct will be
## reset and -if COM interface was used- ActiveX/Excel will be closed.
## However if errors occurred, the file pinter will be untouched so you can
## clean up before a next try with xlsclose().
## Be warned that until xlsopen is called again with the same @var{xls} pointer
## struct, hidden Excel or Java applications with associated (possibly large)
## memory chunks are kept in memory, taking up resources.
## If (string) argument "FORCE" is supplied, the file pointer will be reset 
## regardless, whether the possibly modified file has been saved successfully
## or not. Hidden Excel (COM) or OpenOffice.org (UNO) invocations may live on,
## possibly even impeding proper shutdown of Octave.
##
## @var{filename} can be used to write changed spreadsheet files to
## an other file than opened with xlsopen(); unfortunately this doesn't work
## with JXL (JExcelAPI) interface.
##
## You need MS-Excel (95 - 2010), and/or the Java package => 1.2.8 plus Apache
## POI > 3.5 and/or JExcelAPI and/or OpenXLS and/or OpenOffice.org or clones
## installed on your computer + proper javaclasspath set, to make this
## function work at all.
##
## @var{xls} must be a valid pointer struct made by xlsopen() in the same
## octave session.
##
## Examples:
##
## @example
##   xls1 = xlsclose (xls1);
##   (Close spreadsheet file pointed to in pointer struct xls1; xls1 is reset)
## @end example
##
## @seealso {xlsopen, xlsread, xlswrite, xls2oct, oct2xls, xlsfinfo}
##
## @end deftypefn

## Author: Philip Nienhuis
## Created: 2009-11-29
## Updates: 
## 2010-01-03 (checked OOXML support)
## 2010-08-25 See also: xlsopen (instead of xlsclose)
## 2010-10-20 Improved tracking of file changes and need to write it to disk
## 2010-10-27 Various changes to catch errors when writing to disk;
##     "      Added input arg "keepxls" for use with xlswrite.m to save the
##     "      untouched file ptr struct in case of errors rather than wipe it
## 2010-11-12 Replaced 'keepxls' by new filename arg; catch write errors and
##            always keep file pointer in case of write errors
## 2011-03-26 Added OpenXLS support
## 2011-05-18 Added experimental UNO support, incl. saving newly created files
## 2011-09-08 Bug fix in check for filename input arg
## 2012-01-26 Fixed "seealso" help string
