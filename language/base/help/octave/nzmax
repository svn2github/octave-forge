@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {@var{scalar} =} nzmax (@var{SM})
Return the amount of storage allocated to the sparse matrix @var{SM}.
Note that Octave tends to crop unused memory at the first opportunity
for sparse objects. There are some cases of user created sparse objects
where the value returned by @dfn{nzmaz} will not be the same as @dfn{nnz},
but in general they will give the same result.
