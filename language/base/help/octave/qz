@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {@var{lambda} =} qz (@var{a}, @var{b})
Generalized eigenvalue problem @math{A x = s B x},
@var{QZ} decomposition. There are three ways to call this function:
@enumerate
@item @code{lambda = qz(A,B)}

Computes the generalized eigenvalues
@iftex
@tex
$\lambda$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@var{lambda}
@end ifinfo
of @math{(A - s B)}.
@item @code{[AA, BB, Q, Z, V, W, lambda] = qz (A, B)}

Computes qz decomposition, generalized eigenvectors, and 
generalized eigenvalues of @math{(A - sB)}
@iftex
@tex
$$ AV = BV{ \rm diag }(\lambda) $$
$$ W^T A = { \rm diag }(\lambda)W^T B $$
$$ AA = Q^T AZ, BB = Q^T BZ $$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@example
@group

    A*V = B*V*diag(lambda)
    W'*A = diag(lambda)*W'*B
    AA = Q'*A*Z, BB = Q'*B*Z

@end group
@end example
@end ifinfo
with @var{Q} and @var{Z} orthogonal (unitary)= @var{I}

@item @code{[AA,BB,Z@{, lambda@}] = qz(A,B,opt)}

As in form [2], but allows ordering of generalized eigenpairs
for (e.g.) solution of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations.
Form 3 is not available for complex matrices, and does not compute
the generalized eigenvectors @var{V}, @var{W}, nor the orthogonal matrix @var{Q}.
@table @var
@item opt
for ordering eigenvalues of the GEP pencil.  The leading  block
of the revised pencil contains all eigenvalues that satisfy:
@table @code
@item "N"
= unordered (default) 

@item "S"
= small: leading block has all |lambda| <=1 

@item "B"
= big: leading block has all |lambda| >= 1 

@item "-"
= negative real part: leading block has all eigenvalues
in the open left half-plane

@item "+"
= nonnegative real part: leading block has all eigenvalues
in the closed right half-plane
@end  table
@end table
@end enumerate

Note: qz performs permutation balancing, but not scaling (see balance).
Order of output arguments was selected for compatibility with MATLAB
