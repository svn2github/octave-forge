This is a binary release of Octave 3.2.2 for Windows platform using 
mingw32/gcc build tools. It has been tested on Windows 2K and XP.

Octave-3.2.2_i686-pc-mingw32_gcc-4.3.0_setup.exe

This package contains Octave 3.2.2 and a set of octave-forge packages.
Some packages are missing because external depenency libraries have not 
been built using mingw32/gcc yet.

This package includes notepad++ as text editor and gnuplot as graphical 
engine. It is bundled with the version of GCC used to compile this package 
and a MSYS environment to install octave-forge packages.

This package has been built using TDM GCC-4.3.0-2/mingw32.

The installer can be installed side-by-side with previous versions of
octave/mingw32 and thus does not uninstall any previously installed version 
of octave/mingw32.


Changes since Octave/mingw32 3.2.0:
-----------------------------------

*) The 3.2.2 installer includes the following post-3.2.2 changesets in 
   addition to the octave-3.2.2 sources
   
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/cd95695a0a89  ("dir" crashes)
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/b308b2e12f04  (16bit images)
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/9107c882f193  (speed up "plot")
      
   These adress bugfixes relevant to mingw32 platform.
   These will be included by default in succeeding versions of octave/mingw32.
   
*) The installer includes a Q16 GraphicsMagick build (configured 
   with --quantum-depth=16) to enable lossless reading/writing of
   16bit images.
   
*) The following octave-forge packages have been marked as "-noauto":
      windows-1.0.8
      octcdf-1.0.13
      communications-1.0.10
      ga-0.9.7
      
   This is done to avoid the "clear all" crash if any of these packages
   is selected during the installation. If you require them to be loaded 
   automatically you have to manually set them to, by executing the 
   command(s)
   
      pkg rebuild -auto windows
      pkg rebuild -auto octcdf
      pkg rebuild -auto communications
      pkg rebuild -auto ga
   
   from the octave prompt.
   
   Be advised that this will trigger the "clear all" segfault!


Fixed Issues in 3.2.2:
----------------------

*) The command "dir" should no longer crash on Windows Vista and Windows Server

*) Reading/writing images using GraphicsMagick no longer fails with 
   GraphicsMagick complaining about missing configuration files.

*) Reading/writing 16bit images works without loss of precision


Known Issues with octave/mingw32 3.2.2:
--------------------------------------

*) The command "clear all" results in a segfault.
   This is currently triggered by the following octave-forge packages:
      windows
      octcdf
      communications
      ga (depends on communications)
      
   The error occurs only if any of these packages is marked "-auto" 
   i.e. is loaded at startup.
   
*) The command "clear all" exits with the error message
   
     error: stdin is not a tty!
   
   in conjunction with the ARPACK package e.g. when calling eigs()
   
*) The fixed octave forge package currently does not compile

*) Installing octave respectively running octave from a path which contains
   spaces breaks the installation of octave-forge packages using octave's
   package manager pkg.m.
   It this therefore highly recommended to install octave to a path WITHOUT
   spaces. Octave will work if installed to a path including spaces, and all 
   packages added at the installation will work if installed into a path 
   containing spaces, HOWEVER you will currently NOT be able to install 
   packages using octave's package manager at a later time if Octave was 
   installed to a directory containing spaces.

*) "make check" results:
