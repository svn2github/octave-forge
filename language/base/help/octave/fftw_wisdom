@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} fftw_wisdom (@var{file}, @var{mode})
Save or load FFTW wisdom data to @var{file}.  The optional argument
@var{mode} may be either @samp{"r"} or @samp{"w"}.  The default
value is @samp{"r"}.

@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {} fftw_wisdom (@var{n})
Pre-calculate FFTW wisdom data for an FFT of size @var{n}.
Each row of @var{n} represents the size of an FFT for
which it is desired to pre-calculate the wisdom needed to accelerate it.
Any value of the matrix that is less than 1, is assumed to indicate an
absent dimension.  For example,

@example
fftw_wisdom ([102, 0, 0; 103, 103, 0; 102, 103, 105]);
a = fft (rand (1,102));
b = fft (rand (103,103));
c = fftn (rand ([102, 103, 105]));
@end example

calculates the wisdom necessary to accelerate the 103, 102x102 and
the 102x103x105 FFTs. Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when
restarting Octave. However, the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is
saved to a file as described above.  Also, any system-wide wisdom
file that has been found will also be used. Saved wisdom files
should not be used on different platforms since they will not be
efficient and the point of calculating the wisdom is lost.

Wisdom data can be used to significantly accelerate the calculation
of the FFTs but is only profitable if the same FFT is called many
times due to the overhead in calculating the wisdom data.

Note that the program @code{fftw-wisdom} supplied with FFTW can equally
be used to create a file containing wisdom that can be imported into
Octave.
