@deftypefn {Function File} {} plot3 (@var{args})

This function produces three-dimensional plots.  Many different
combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

@example
plot3 (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{z})
@end example

@noindent
where the arguments are taken to be the vertices of the points to be
plotted in three dimensions. If all arguments are vectors of the same
length, then a single continuous line is drawn. If all arguments are
matrices, then each column of the matrices is treated as a seperate
line. No attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the
number of rows match.

Additionally, only two arguments can be given as

@example
plot3 (@var{x}, @var{c})
@end example

where the real and imaginary parts of the second argument are used as
the @var{y} and @var{z} coordinates, respectively.

If only one argument is given, as

@example
plot3 (@var{c})
@end example

the real and imaginary parts of the argument are used as the @var{y}
and @var{z} values, and they are plotted versus their index.

To save a plot, in one of several image formats such as PostScript
or PNG, use the @code{print} command.

See @code{__pltopt__} for a description of the optional format
argument.

Arguments can also be given in groups of three as

@example
plot3 (@var{x1}, @var{y1}, @var{z1}, @var{x2}, @var{y2}, @var{z2}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
where each set of three arguments is treated as a seperate line or
set of lines in three dimensions.

To plot multiple one- or two-argument groups, separate each group with an
empty format string, as

@example
plot3 (@var{x1}, @var{c1}, '', @var{c2}, '', @dots{})
@end example

An example of the use of plot3 is

@example
@group
   z = [0:0.05:5];
   plot3(cos(2*pi*z), sin(2*pi*z), z, ";helix;");
   plot3(z, exp(2i*pi*z), ";complex sinusoid;");
@end group
@end example
