@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {[@var{a}, @var{ierr}] =} airy (@var{k}, @var{z}, @var{opt})
Compute Airy functions of the first and second kind, and their
derivatives.

@example
 K   Function   Scale factor (if 'opt' is supplied)
---  --------   ---------------------------------------
 0   Ai (Z)     exp ((2/3) * Z * sqrt (Z))
 1   dAi(Z)/dZ  exp ((2/3) * Z * sqrt (Z))
 2   Bi (Z)     exp (-abs (real ((2/3) * Z *sqrt (Z))))
 3   dBi(Z)/dZ  exp (-abs (real ((2/3) * Z *sqrt (Z))))
@end example

The function call @code{airy (@var{z})} is equivalent to
@code{airy (0, @var{z})}.

The result is the same size as @var{z}.

If requested, @var{ierr} contains the following status information and
is the same size as the result.

@enumerate 0
@item
Normal return.
@item
Input error, return @code{NaN}.
@item
Overflow, return @code{Inf}.
@item
Loss of significance by argument reduction results in less than half
 of machine accuracy.
@item
Complete loss of significance by argument reduction, return @code{NaN}.
@item
Error---no computation, algorithm termination condition not met,
return @code{NaN}.
@end enumerate
@end deftypefn
