@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {[@var{x}, @var{xdot}, @var{istate}, @var{msg}] =} dassl (@var{fcn}, @var{x_0}, @var{xdot_0}, @var{t}, @var{t_crit})
Solve the set of differential-algebraic equations
@iftex
@tex
$$ 0 = f (x, \dot{x}, t) $$
with
$$ x(t_0) = x_0, \dot{x}(t_0) = \dot{x}_0 $$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo

@example
0 = f (x, xdot, t)
@end example

@noindent
with

@example
x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0
@end example

@end ifinfo
The solution is returned in the matrices @var{x} and @var{xdot},
with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the
elements in the vector @var{t}.  The first element of @var{t}
should be @math{t_0} and correspond to the initial state of the
system @var{x_0} and its derivative @var{xdot_0}, so that the first
row of the output @var{x} is @var{x_0} and the first row
of the output @var{xdot} is @var{xdot_0}.

The first argument, @var{fcn}, is a string or a two element cell array
of strings, inline or function handle, that names the function, to call
to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations. It must
have the form

@example
@var{res} = f (@var{x}, @var{xdot}, @var{t})
@end example

@noindent
in which @var{x}, @var{xdot}, and @var{res} are vectors, and @var{t} is a
scalar.

If @var{fcn} is a two-element string array, the first element names
the function @math{f} described above, and the second element names
a function to compute the modified Jacobian

@iftex
@tex
$$
J = {\partial f \over \partial x}
  + c {\partial f \over \partial \dot{x}}
$$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@example
      df       df
jac = -- + c ------
      dx     d xdot
@end example
@end ifinfo

The modified Jacobian function must have the form

@example

@var{jac} = j (@var{x}, @var{xdot}, @var{t}, @var{c})

@end example

The second and third arguments to @code{dassl} specify the initial
condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument
specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired,
including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to
be consistent.  In practice, however, @sc{Dassl} is not very good at
determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that
the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for
avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a
discontinuity in the derivative.

After a successful computation, the value of @var{istate} will be
greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of @sc{Dassl}).

If the computation is not successful, the value of @var{istate} will be
less than zero and @var{msg} will contain additional information.

You can use the function @code{dassl_options} to set optional
parameters for @code{dassl}.
