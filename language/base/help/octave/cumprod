@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} cumprod (@var{x}, @var{dim})
Cumulative product of elements along dimension @var{dim}.  If
@var{dim} is omitted, it defaults to 1 (column-wise cumulative
products).

As a special case, if @var{x} is a vector and @var{dim} is omitted,
return the cumulative product of the elements as a vector with the
same orientation as @var{x}.
@end deftypefn
