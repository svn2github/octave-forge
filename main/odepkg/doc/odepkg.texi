@cindex Beginners's Guide
The ``Beginner's Guide'' is intended for new users who want to solve differential equations with the higher level language Octave and OdePkg. It will be explained what OdePkg is about in @ref{About OdePkg and this document} and how OdePkg grew up from the beginning in @ref{OdePkg history and roadmap}. In <TODO> it is explained how OdePkg can be installed and in <TODO> there are already the first test and demo examples-

@node About OdePkg and this document
@section About OdePkg and this document
@cindex About@dots
OdePkg is part of the @b{GNU Octave Repository} (resp. the Octave--Forge project) that is hosted at @url{http://octave.sourceforge.net}. The package includes commands for setting up options, output functions etc. before solving a set of differential equations. OdePkg formerly was initiated to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) but there are already improvements so that differential algebraic equations (DAEs) can be solved also. At this time OdePkg is under development with the main target, to make a package that is mostly compatible to the solver functions of the @b{<TODO>}.

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .75
@item OdePkg Version 0.0.1
@tab The initial release was already a modification of the old ``ode package'' that was hosted at Octave--Forge and that was written by Marc Compere somewhen 2000@dots{}2001. The four variable step--size Runge--Kutta solvers and the four fixed step--size solvers have been merged. It was possible to set some options for these solvers. The four output--functions (@command{odeprint}, @command{odeplot}, @command{odephas2} and @command{odephas3}) have been added along with other examples that initialy have not been there.
@item OdePkg Version 0.1.x
@tab The major milestone along version 0.1.x was that four stable solvers have been implemented (ie. @command{ode23}, @command{ode45}, @command{ode54} and @command{ode78}) supporting all options that can be set for these kind of solvers and also all necessary functions for setting their options (eg. @command{odeset}, @command{odepkg_structure_check}, etc.). Since version 0.1.3 there is also code available that interfaces the Fortran solver @file{dopri5.f} that is written by Ernst Hairer and Gerhard Wanner (cf. @file{odepkg_mexsolver_dopri5.c} and the helper files @file{odepkgext.c} and @file{odepkgmex.c}).
@item @b{(current)} Version 0.2.x
@tab The main work that has to be done along version 0.2.x is to make the interface functions for the solvers of Hairer and Wanner stable enough, so that they can be installed by default (by now they have to be installed by hand if somebody wants them).
@item @b{(future)} Version 0.3.x
@tab All interface functions for the solvers of Hairer and Wanner are stable so that they can be installed by default (via a @file{Makefile} or the @file{PKA_ADD} file). Finished adding all wrapper functions and help descriptions for theses solvers, added tests and demos for these solvers. Ongoing work with this manual.
@item @b{(future)} Version 0.4.x
@tab Maybe some of the Hindmarsh, Brown and Petzold solvers are added, but I think I prefer the solvers of Jeff Cash instead.
@item @b{(future)} Version 0.5.x
@tab Finished most work with this manual. Manual is build by default, making rules have been added to the OdePkg. A lot of compatibility tests will be done.
@item @b{(future)} Version 0.6.x
@tab Final release before version 1.0.0.
@item @b{(future)} Version 1.0.0
@tab Completed odepkg release 1.0.0 with m--solvers and mex--solvers.
@end multitable

@section Installation and deinstallation
@cindex Installation
OdePkg can be installed easily using the @command{pkg} command of Octave. Therefore get into the directory where the current release of OdePkg can be found, start @command{octave} and type
@example
pkg install odepkg-x.x.x.tar.gz
@end example
where @file{x.x.x} in the name of the @file{*.tar.gz} file is the current release number that is available. If you want to deinstall resp. remove OdePkg then simply type
@example
pkg uninstall odepkg-x.x.x.tar.gz
@end example
If you encounter problems when installing OdePkg with the @command{pkg} command or if you have an OdePkg that seems to be broken then please report this on the mailing--list of Octave--Forge using the email adress @email{octave-dev@@lists.sourceforge.net}.
