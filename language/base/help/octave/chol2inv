@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} chol2inv (@var{u})
Invert a symmetric, positive definite square matrix from its Cholesky
decomposition, @var{u}.  Note that @var{u} should be an upper-triangular
matrix with positive diagonal elements.  @code{chol2inv (@var{u})}
provides @code{inv (@var{u}'*@var{u})} but it is much faster than
using @code{inv}.
