For a symmetric positive definite matrix @var{s}, returns the permutation
vector p such that @code{@var{s} (@var{p}, @var{p})} tends to have a
sparser Cholesky factor than @var{s}. Sometimes SYMAMD works well for
symmetric indefinite matrices too. The matrix @var{s} is assumed to be
symmetric; only the strictly lower triangular part is referenced. @var{s}
must be square.

@var{knobs} is an optional one- to two-element input vector.  If @var{s} is
n-by-n, then rows and columns with more than
@code{max(16,@var{knobs}(1)*sqrt(n))} entries are removed prior to ordering,
and ordered last in the output permutation @var{p}. No rows/columns are
removed if @code{@var{knobs}(1) < 0}.  If @code{@var{knobs} (2)} is nonzero,
@code{stats} and @var{knobs} are printed.  The default is @code{@var{knobs} 
= [10 0]}.  Note that @var{knobs} differs from earlier versions of symamd.

@var{stats} is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data
about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix @var{s}. Ordering
statistics are in @code{@var{stats} (1:3)}. @code{@var{stats} (1) =
@var{stats} (2)} is the number of dense or empty rows and columns
ignored by SYMAMD and @code{@var{stats} (3)} is the number of garbage
collections performed on the internal data structure used by SYMAMD
(roughly of size @code{8.4 * nnz (tril (@var{s}, -1)) + 9 * @var{n}}
integers).

Octave built-in functions are intended to generate valid sparse matrices,
with no duplicate entries, with ascending row indices of the nonzeros
in each column, with a non-negative number of entries in each column (!)
and so on.  If a matrix is invalid, then SYMAMD may or may not be able
to continue.  If there are duplicate entries (a row index appears two or
more times in the same column) or if the row indices in a column are out
of order, then SYMAMD can correct these errors by ignoring the duplicate
entries and sorting each column of its internal copy of the matrix S (the
input matrix S is not repaired, however).  If a matrix is invalid in
other ways then SYMAMD cannot continue, an error message is printed, and
no output arguments (@var{p} or @var{stats}) are returned.  SYMAMD is
thus a simple way to check a sparse matrix to see if it's valid.

@code{@var{stats} (4:7)} provide information if SYMAMD was able to
continue. The matrix is OK if @code{@var{stats} (4)} is zero, or 1
if invalid. @code{@var{stats} (5)} is the rightmost column index that
is unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column
exists. @code{@var{stats} (6)} is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order
row index in the column index given by @code{@var{stats} (5)}, or zero
if no such row index exists. @code{@var{stats} (7)} is the number of
duplicate or out-of-order row indices. @code{@var{stats} (8:20)} is
always zero in the current version of SYMAMD (reserved for future use).

The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.
