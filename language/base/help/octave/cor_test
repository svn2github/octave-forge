@deftypefn {Function File} {} cor_test (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt}, @var{method})
Test whether two samples @var{x} and @var{y} come from uncorrelated
populations.

The optional argument string @var{alt} describes the alternative
hypothesis, and can be @code{"!="} or @code{"<>"} (non-zero),
@code{">"} (greater than 0), or @code{"<"} (less than 0).  The
default is the two-sided case.

The optional argument string @var{method} specifies on which
correlation coefficient the test should be based.  If @var{method} is
@code{"pearson"} (default), the (usual) Pearson's product moment
correlation coefficient is used.  In this case, the data should come
from a bivariate normal distribution.  Otherwise, the other two
methods offer nonparametric alternatives. If @var{method} is
@code{"kendall"}, then Kendall's rank correlation tau is used.  If
@var{method} is @code{"spearman"}, then Spearman's rank correlation
rho is used.  Only the first character is necessary.

The output is a structure with the following elements:

@table @var
@item pval
The p-value of the test.
@item stat
The value of the test statistic.
@item dist
The distribution of the test statistic.
@item params
The parameters of the null distribution of the test statistic.
@item alternative
The alternative hypothesis.
@item method
The method used for testing.
@end table

If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.
