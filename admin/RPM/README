Builds of octave-forge are closely tied to the octave version
installed on the system at build time. The octave-forge.spec file
should therefore depend on that specific version. This and several
other details were originally configured by autoconf, but that fixes
the dependency to the version of octave installed on the system
requires the system on which the octave-forge release was generated,
which does not allow the flexbility of using this octave-forge.spec
file on a system with a different version of octave without editing
it. The spec file has now been modified so that it is general enough
to work with any octave release installed on the user's system.
However, to be completely correct, the RPM package built with the
octave-forge.spec file should depend on the exact octave version
installed on the system, so the update_spec.sh file included in this
directory can be used to automatically update the octave-forge.spec
file by the end user. All other build-time octave dependency
information are now determined at build time by the scripts in the
spec file.
