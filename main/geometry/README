These are some function for computational geometry. They depend on
the qhull library (http://www.qhull.org). 

Build Instructions
------------------

First you need the qhull library.

a.) Unpack the qhull source (binaries exist for Debian and Red Hat).

b.) Add the following lines to the Makefile:

libqhull.so: $(OBJS)
	c++ -shared -Xlinker -soname -Xlinker $@ -o libqhull.so $(OBJS)

c.) Build the shared library

	make libqhull.so

d.) Install the lib to place where the linker can find it.
	cp libqhull.so /usr/local/lib
	ldconfig -v.

e.) Copy all the header files where the C compiler can find them
	mkdir /usr/local/include/qhull
	cp qhull/src/*.h /usr/local/include/qhull

Next you need to build the geometry toolbox.

a.) if you are using this package as part of OctaveSF, return the root
    of the OctaveSF tree and follow the instructions in INSTALL

b.) if you are using this package independently, just type

	make

    and either copy the m-files and oct-files from the current
    directory onto your octave path or update your path to include
    the current directory.
