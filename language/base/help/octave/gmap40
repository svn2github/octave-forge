@deftypefn {Function File} {} gmap40 (@var{n})
Create a color colormap. The colormap is red, green, blue, yellow,
magneta and cyan. These are the colors that are allowed with patch
objects using gnuplot 4.0, and so this colormap function is specially
designed for users of gnuplot 4.0.  The argument @var{n} should be 
a scalar.  If it is omitted, a length of 6 is assumed. Larger values
of @var{n} result in a repetition of the above colors
