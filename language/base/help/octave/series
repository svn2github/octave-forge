Type of input: Transfer functions
Command:       [num,den]=series(num1,den1,num2,den2)
Forms the series representation of the two transfer functions.

Type of input: State space systems
Command:       [a,b,c,d]=series(a1,b1,c1,d1,a2,b2,c2,d2)
Forms the series representation of the two state space system arguments.
The series connected system will have the inputs of system 1 and the
outputs of system 2.

Type of input: system data structure
Command:       syst=series(syst1,syst2)
Forms the series representation of the two mu system arguments.
