@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {@var{aa} =} balance (@var{a}, @var{opt})
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {[@var{dd}, @var{aa}] =} balance (@var{a}, @var{opt})
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {[@var{cc}, @var{dd}, @var{aa}, @var{bb}] =} balance (@var{a}, @var{b}, @var{opt})

Compute @code{aa = dd \ a * dd} in which @code{aa} is a matrix whose
row and column norms are roughly equal in magnitude, and
@code{dd} = @code{p * d}, in which @code{p} is a permutation
matrix and @code{d} is a diagonal matrix of powers of two.  This allows
the equilibration to be computed without roundoff.  Results of
eigenvalue calculation are typically improved by balancing first.

If four output values are requested, compute @code{aa = cc*a*dd} and
@code{bb = cc*b*dd)}, in which @code{aa} and @code{bb} have non-zero
elements of approximately the same magnitude and @code{cc} and @code{dd}
are permuted diagonal matrices as in @code{dd} for the algebraic
eigenvalue problem.

The eigenvalue balancing option @code{opt} may be one of:

@table @asis
@item @code{"N"}, @code{"n"}
No balancing; arguments copied, transformation(s) set to identity.

@item @code{"P"}, @code{"p"}
Permute argument(s) to isolate eigenvalues where possible.

@item @code{"S"}, @code{"s"}
Scale to improve accuracy of computed eigenvalues.

@item @code{"B"}, @code{"b"}
Permute and scale, in that order. Rows/columns of a (and b)
that are isolated by permutation are not scaled.  This is the default
behavior.
@end table

Algebraic eigenvalue balancing uses standard @sc{Lapack} routines.

Generalized eigenvalue problem balancing uses Ward's algorithm
(SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 1981).
