/*! \mainpage C++ API
 *
 *  This is the documentation for the C++ APIs for version 
 *  3.2 of GNU Octave. It is mainly useful as a reference to the 
 *  API and is <b>not</b> intended as an introduction to working with C++ and 
 *  Octave. For an introduction to working with the C++ API see the 
 *  <a href="http://www.octave.org/doc/interpreter/">Octave manual</a> or 
 *  <a href="http://octave.sf.net/coda/index.html">Da Coda Al Fine</a>.
 *
 *  It should be noted that the C++ API is only stable within minor revisions
 *  of GNU Octave. Hence the API for e.g. version 3.2.0 is that same as in 3.2.1,
 *  but not necessaryly the same as in 3.4.0.
