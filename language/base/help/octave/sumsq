@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} sumsq (@var{x}, @var{dim})
Sum of squares of elements along dimension @var{dim}.  If @var{dim}
is omitted, it defaults to 1 (column-wise sum of squares).

As a special case, if @var{x} is a vector and @var{dim} is omitted,
return the sum of squares of the elements.

This function is conceptually equivalent to computing
@example
sum (x .* conj (x), dim)
@end example
but it uses less memory and avoids calling conj if @var{x} is real.
@end deftypefn
