@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} spdiag (@var{v}, @var{k})
Return a diagonal matrix with the sparse vector @var{v} on diagonal
@var{k}. The second argument is optional. If it is positive, the vector is
placed on the @var{k}-th super-diagonal. If it is negative, it is placed
on the @var{-k}-th sub-diagonal.  The default value of @var{k} is 0, and
the vector is placed on the main diagonal.  For example,

@example
spdiag ([1, 2, 3], 1)
ans =

Compressed Column Sparse (rows=4, cols=4, nnz=3)
  (1 , 2) -> 1
  (2 , 3) -> 2
  (3 , 4) -> 3
