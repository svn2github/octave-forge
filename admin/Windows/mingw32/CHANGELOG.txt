
Changes since Octave/mingw32 3.2.0:
-----------------------------------

*) The 3.2.2 installer includes the following post-3.2.2 changesets in 
   addition to the octave-3.2.2 sources
   
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/cd95695a0a89  ("dir" crashes)
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/b308b2e12f04  (16bit images)
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/9107c882f193  (speed up "plot")
      
   These adress bugfixes relevant to mingw32 platform.
   These will be included by default in succeeding versions of octave/mingw32.
   
*) The installer includes a Q16 GraphicsMagick build (configured 
   with --quantum-depth=16) to enable lossless reading/writing of
   16bit images.
   
*) The following octave-forge packages have been marked as "-noauto":
      windows-1.0.8
      octcdf-1.0.13
      communications-1.0.10
      ga-0.9.7
      
   This is done to avoid the "clear all" crash if any of these packages
   is selected during the installation. If you require them to be loaded 
   automatically you have to manually set them to, by executing the 
   command(s)
   
      pkg rebuild -auto windows
      pkg rebuild -auto octcdf
      pkg rebuild -auto communications
      pkg rebuild -auto ga
   
   from the octave prompt.
   
   Be advised that this will trigger the "clear all" segfault!


Fixed Issues in 3.2.2:
----------------------

*) The command "dir" should no longer crash on Windows Vista and Windows Server

*) Reading/writing images using GraphicsMagick no longer fails with 
   GraphicsMagick complaining about missing configuration files.

*) Reading/writing 16bit images works without loss of precision
