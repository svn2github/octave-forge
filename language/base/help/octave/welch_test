@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{t}, @var{df}] =} welch_test (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
For two samples @var{x} and @var{y} from normal distributions with
unknown means and unknown and not necessarily equal variances,
perform a Welch test of the null hypothesis of equal means.
Under the null, the test statistic t approximately follows a Student
distribution with df degrees of freedom.

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
@code{mean (@var{x}) != @var{m}}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
one-sided alternative mean(x) > @var{m} is considered.  Similarly for
@code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative mean(x) < @var{m} is
considered.  The default is the two-sided case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
