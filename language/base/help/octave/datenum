@strong{Warning:} this function does not attempt to handle Julian
calendars so dates before Octave 15, 1582 are wrong by as much
as eleven days.  Also be aware that only Roman Catholic countries
adopted the calendar in 1582.  It took until 1924 for it to be 
adopted everywhere.  See the Wikipedia entry on the Gregorian 
calendar for more details.

@strong{Warning:} leap seconds are ignored.  A table of leap seconds
is available on the Wikipedia entry for leap seconds.
