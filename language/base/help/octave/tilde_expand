@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} tilde_expand (@var{string})
Performs tilde expansion on @var{string}.  If @var{string} begins with a
tilde character, (@samp{~}), all of the characters preceding the first
slash (or all characters, if there is no slash) are treated as a
possible user name, and the tilde and the following characters up to the
slash are replaced by the home directory of the named user.  If the
tilde is followed immediately by a slash, the tilde is replaced by the
home directory of the user running Octave.  For example,

@example
@group
tilde_expand ("~joeuser/bin")
     @result{} "/home/joeuser/bin"
tilde_expand ("~/bin")
     @result{} "/home/jwe/bin"
@end group
@end example
@end deftypefn
