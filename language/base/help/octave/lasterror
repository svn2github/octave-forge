@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {@var{err} =} lasterror (@var{err})
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {} lasterror ('reset')
Returns or sets the last error message. Called without any arguments
returns a structure containing the last error message, as well as other
information related to this error. The elements of this structure are:

@table @asis
@item 'message'
The text of the last error message
@item 'identifier'
The message identifier of this error message
@item 'stack'
A structure containing information on where the message occurred. This might
be an empty structure if this in the case where this information can not
be obtained. The fields of this structure are:

@table @asis
@item 'file'
The name of the file where the error occurred
@item 'name'
The name of function in which the error occurred
@item 'line'
The line number at which the error occurred
@item 'column'
An optional field with the column number at which the error occurred
@end table
@end table

The @var{err} structure may also be passed to @code{lasterror} to set the
information about the last error. The only constraint on @var{err} in that
case is that it is a scalar structure. Any fields of @var{err} that match
the above are set to the value passed in @var{err}, while other fields are
set to their default values.

If @code{lasterror} is called with the argument 'reset', all values take
their default values.
