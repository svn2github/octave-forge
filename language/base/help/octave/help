@deffn {Command} help
Octave's @code{help} command can be used to print brief usage-style
messages, or to display information directly from an on-line version of
the printed manual, using the GNU Info browser.  If invoked without any
arguments, @code{help} prints a list of all the available operators
and functions.  If the first argument is @code{-i}, the @code{help}
command searches the index of the on-line version of this manual for
the given topics.

For example, the command @kbd{help help} prints a short message
describing the @code{help} command, and @kbd{help -i help} starts the
GNU Info browser at this node in the on-line version of the manual.

Once the GNU Info browser is running, help for using it is available
using the command @kbd{C-h}.
