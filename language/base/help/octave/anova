@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{f}, @var{df_b}, @var{df_w}] =} anova (@var{y}, @var{g})
Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).  The goal is to test
whether the population means of data taken from @var{k} different
groups are all equal.

Data may be given in a single vector @var{y} with groups specified by
a corresponding vector of group labels @var{g} (e.g., numbers from 1
to @var{k}). This is the general form which does not impose any
restriction on the number of data in each group or the group labels.

If @var{y} is a matrix and @var{g} is omitted, each column of @var{y}
is treated as a group.  This form is only appropriate for balanced
ANOVA in which the numbers of samples from each group are all equal.

Under the null of constant means, the statistic @var{f} follows an F
distribution with @var{df_b} and @var{df_w} degrees of freedom.

The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{f}) is
returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the standard one-way ANOVA table is
printed.
