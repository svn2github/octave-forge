@deftypefn {Function File} {} plot3 (@var{args})
Produce three-dimensional plots.  Many different combinations of
arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

@example
plot3 (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{z})
@end example

@noindent
in which the arguments are taken to be the vertices of the points to
be plotted in three dimensions. If all arguments are vectors of the
same length, then a single continuous line is drawn. If all arguments
are matrices, then each column of the matrices is treated as a
separate line.  No attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make
the number of rows match.

If only two arguments are given, as

@example
plot3 (@var{x}, @var{c})
@end example

@noindent
the real and imaginary parts of the second argument are used
as the @var{y} and @var{z} coordinates, respectively.

If only one argument is given, as

@example
plot3 (@var{c})
@end example

@noindent
the real and imaginary parts of the argument are used as the @var{y}
and @var{z} values, and they are plotted versus their index.

Arguments may also be given in groups of three as

@example
plot3 (@var{x1}, @var{y1}, @var{z1}, @var{x2}, @var{y2}, @var{z2}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
in which each set of three arguments is treated as a separate line or
set of lines in three dimensions.

To plot multiple one- or two-argument groups, separate each group
with an empty format string, as

@example
plot3 (@var{x1}, @var{c1}, "", @var{c2}, "", @dots{})
@end example

An example of the use of @code{plot3} is

@example
@group
   z = [0:0.05:5];
   plot3 (cos(2*pi*z), sin(2*pi*z), z, ";helix;");
   plot3 (z, exp(2i*pi*z), ";complex sinusoid;");
@end group
@end example
@seealso{plot}
@end deftypefn
