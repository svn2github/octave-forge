@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {@var{lambda} =} eig (@var{a})
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {[@var{v}, @var{lambda}] =} eig (@var{a})
The eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) of a matrix are computed in a several
step process which begins with a Hessenberg decomposition, followed by a
Schur decomposition, from which the eigenvalues are apparent.  The
eigenvectors, when desired, are computed by further manipulations of the
Schur decomposition.

The eigenvalues returned by @code{eig} are not ordered.
