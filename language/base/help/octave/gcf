@deftypefn {Function File} {} gcf ()
Return the current figure handle.  If a figure does not exist, create
one and return its handle.  The handle may then be used to examine or
set properties of the figure.  For example,

@example
@group
fplot (@@sin, [-10, 10]);
fig = gcf ();
set (fig, "visible", "off");
@end group
@end example

@noindent
plots a sine wave, finds the handle of the current figure, and then
makes that figure invisible.  Setting the visible property of the
figure to @code{"on"} will cause it to be displayed again.
@seealso{get, set}
@end deftypefn
