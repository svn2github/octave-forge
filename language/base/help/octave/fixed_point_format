@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {@var{val} =} fixed_point_format ()
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {@var{old_val} =} fixed_point_format (@var{new_val})
Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave will
use a scaled format to print matrix values such that the largest
element may be written with a single leading digit with the scaling
factor is printed on the first line of output.  For example,

@example
@group
octave:1> logspace (1, 7, 5)'
ans =

  1.0e+07  *

  0.00000
  0.00003
  0.00100
  0.03162
  1.00000
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Notice that first value appears to be zero when it is actually 1.  For
this reason, you should be careful when setting
@code{fixed_point_format} to a nonzero value.
