@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {@var{val} =} echo_executing_commands ()
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {@var{old_val} =} echo_executing_commands (@var{new_val})
Query or set the internal variable that controls the echo state.
It may be the sum of the following values:

@table @asis
@item 1
Echo commands read from script files.

@item 2
Echo commands from functions.

@item 4
Echo commands read from command line.
@end table

More than one state can be active at once.  For example, a value of 3 is
equivalent to the command @kbd{echo on all}.

The value of @code{echo_executing_commands} is set by the @kbd{echo}
command and the command line option @code{--echo-input}.
@end deftypefn
