Manage FFTW wisdom data. Wisdom data can be used to significantly
accelerate the calculation of the FFTs but implies a initial cost
in its calculation. The wisdom used by Octave can be imported directly,
usually from a file /etc/fftw/wisdom, or @dfn{fftw} can be used
to import wisdom. For example

@example
@var{wisdom} = fftw ('dwisdom')
@end example

will save the existing wisdom used by Octave to the string @var{wisdom}.
This string can then be saved in the usual manner. This existing wisdom
can be reimported as follows

@example
fftw ('dwisdom', @var{wisdom})
@end example 

If @var{wisdom} is an empty matrix, then the wisdom used is cleared.

During the calculation of fourier transforms further wisdom is generated.
The fashion in which this wisdom is generated is equally controlled by
the @dfn{fftw} function. There are five different manners in which the
wisdom can be treated, these being

@table @asis
@item 'estimate'
This specifies that no run-time measurement of the optimal means of
calculating a particular is performed, and a simple heuristic is used
to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan. The advantage of this method is
that there is little or no overhead in the generation of the plan, which
is appropriate for a fourier transform that will be calculated once.

@item 'measure'
In this case a range of algorithms to perform the transform is considered
and the best is selected based on their execution time.

@item 'patient'
This is like 'measure', but a wider range of algorithms is considered.

@item 'exhasutive'
This is like 'meaure', but all possible algorithms that may be used to
treat the transform are considered.

@item 'hybrid'
As run-time measurement of the algorithm can be expensive, this is a
compromise where 'measure' is used for transforms upto the size of 8192
and beyond that the 'estimate' method is used.
@end table

The default method is 'estimate', and the method currently being used can
be probed with

@example
@var{method} = fftw ('planner')
@end example

and the method used can be set using

@example
fftw ('planner', @var{method})
@end example

Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when restarting Octave. However,
the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is saved to a file as described
above.  Also, any system-wide wisdom file that has been found will
also be used. Saved wisdom files should not be used on different
platforms since they will not be efficient and the point of calculating
the wisdom is lost.
