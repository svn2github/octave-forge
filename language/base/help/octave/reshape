@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} reshape (@var{a}, @var{m}, @var{n}, @dots{})
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {} reshape (@var{a}, @var{siz})
Return a matrix with the given dimensions whose elements are taken
from the matrix @var{a}.  The elements of the matrix are accessed in
column-major order (like Fortran arrays are stored).

For example,

@example
@group
reshape ([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 2)
     @result{}  1  3
         2  4
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Note that the total number of elements in the original
matrix must match the total number of elements in the new matrix.

A single dimension of the return matrix can be unknown and is flagged
by an empty argument.
@end deftypefn
