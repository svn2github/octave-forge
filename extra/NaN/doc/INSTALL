Installing the NaN-tb for Octave and Matlab:
--------------------------------------------
a) Extract files and save them in /your/directory/structure/to/NaN/

b) Include the path with one of the following commands: 
	addpath('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/')
	addpath('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/inst')
	addpath('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/src')

   The NaN-toolbox redefines some standard functions like mean, var, std, cor, cov, corrcoef, etc.
   You can avoid this by including the directories at the end of the path
   
	addpath('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/','-end')
	addpath('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/inst','-end')
	addpath('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/src','-end')

   Make sure the functions in the NaN-toolbox are found before the default functions.

c) run NANINSTTEST 
This checks whether the installation was successful.

d) [OPTIONAL]:
  Several mex-files are strongly recommened. 	
  Run MAKE from the directory .../NaN/src/ 	

  Run NANINSTTEST again to check the stability of the compiled SUMSKIPNAN.
