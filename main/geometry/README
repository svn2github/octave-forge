These are some function for computational geometry. They depend on
the qhull library [1]. 

Build Instructions
------------------

First you need the qhull library.

a.) install the qhull program from [2]. 

    Add the following target to src/Makefile:

libqhull.so: $(OBJS)
	c++ -shared -Xlinker -soname -Xlinker $@ -o libqhull.so $(OBJS)

    Build the shared library

	make libqhull.so

    Install the lib to place where the linker can find it.
	cp libqhull.so /usr/local/lib
	ldconfig -v.

    Copy all the header files where the C compiler can find them
	mkdir /usr/local/include/qhull
	cp qhull/src/*.h /usr/local/include/qhull

b.) Download a qhull 'lite' package from my homepage. [3]
	
	make
	make install

    The lite package contains only the files needed to build the 
    lib and a adapted Makefile. I have removed all docfiles, too. 
    So, if you want to develop with qhull choose the package from [2].

Next you need to build the geometry toolbox.

a.) if you are using this package as part of OctaveSF, return the root
    of the OctaveSF tree and follow the instructions in INSTALL

b.) if you are using this package independently, just type

	make

    and either copy the m-files and oct-files from the current
    directory onto your octave LOADPATH or update your LOADPATH
    to include the current directory.
