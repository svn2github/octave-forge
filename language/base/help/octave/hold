@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} hold @var{args}
Tell Octave to `hold' the current data on the plot when executing
subsequent plotting commands.  This allows you to execute a series of
plot commands and have all the lines end up on the same figure.  The
default is for each new plot command to clear the plot device first.
For example, the command

@example
hold on
@end example

@noindent
turns the hold state on.  An argument of @code{"off"} turns the hold
state off, and @code{hold} with no arguments toggles the current hold
state.
@end deftypefn
