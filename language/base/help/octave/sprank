@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {@var{p} =} sprank (@var{s})

@cindex Structural Rank
Calculates the structural rank of a sparse matrix @var{s}. Note that
only the structure of the matrix is used in this calculation based on
a Dulmage-Mendelsohn to block triangular form. As such the numerical
rank of the matrix @var{s} is bounded by @code{sprank (@var{s}) >=
rank (@var{s})}. Ignoring floating point errors @code{sprank (@var{s}) ==
rank (@var{s})}.
