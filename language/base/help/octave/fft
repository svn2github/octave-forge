@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} fft (@var{a}, @var{n}, @var{dim})
Compute the FFT of @var{a} using subroutines from
@sc{Fftw}. The FFT is calculated along the first non-singleton dimension of the
array. Thus if @var{a} is a matrix, @code{fft (@var{a})} computes the
FFT for each column of @var{a}.

If called with two arguments, @var{n} is expected to be an integer
specifying the number of elements of @var{a} to use, or an empty
matrix to specify that its value should be ignored. If @var{n} is
larger than the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then
@var{a} is resized and padded with zeros. Otherwise, if @var{n} is
smaller than the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then
@var{a} is truncated.

If called with three arguments, @var{dim} is an integer specifying the
dimension of the matrix along which the FFT is performed
