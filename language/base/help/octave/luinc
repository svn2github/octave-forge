@cindex LU decomposition
Produce the incomplete LU factorization of the sparse matrix @var{a}.
Two types of incomplete factorization are possible, and the type
is determined by the second argument to @dfn{luinc}.

Called with a second argument of '0', the zero-level incomplete
LU factorization is produced. This creates a factorization of @var{a}
where the position of the non-zero arguments correspond to the same
positions as in the matrix @var{a}.

Alternatively, the fill-in of the incomplete LU factorization can
be controlled through the variable @var{droptol} or the structure
@var{opts}. The UMFPACK multifrontal factorization code by Tim A.
Davis is used for the incomplete LU factorication, (availability
@url{http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/})

@var{droptol} determines the values below which the values in the LU
factorization are dropped and replaced by zero. It must be a positive
scalar, and any values in the factorization whose absolute value are
less than this value are dropped, expect if leaving them increase the
sparsity of the matrix. Setting @var{droptol} to zero results in a
complete LU factorization which is the default.

@var{opts} is a structure containing one or more of the fields

@table @code
@item droptol
The drop tolerance as above. If @var{opts} only contains @code{droptol}
then this is equivalent to using the variable @var{droptol}.

@item milu
A logical variable flagging whether to use the modified incomplete LU
factorization. In the case that @code{milu} is true, the dropped values
are subtract from the diagonal of the matrix U of the factorization.
The default is @code{false}.

@item udiag
A logical variable that flags whether zero elements on the diagonal of U
should be replaced with @var{droptol} to attempt to avoid singular
factors. The default is @code{false}.

@item thresh
Defines the pivot threshold in the interval [0,1]. Values outside that
range are ignored.
@end table

All other fields in @var{opts} are ignored. The outputs from @dfn{luinc}
are the same as for @dfn{lu}.
