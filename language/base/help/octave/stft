@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{y}, @var{c}]} = stft (@var{x}, @var{win_size}, @var{inc}, @var{num_coef}, @var{w_type})
Compute the short-term Fourier transform of the vector @var{x} with
@var{num_coef} coefficients by applying a window of @var{win_size} data
points and an increment of @var{inc} points.

Before computing the Fourier transform, one of the following windows
is applied:

@table @asis
@item hanning
w_type = 1
@item hamming
w_type = 2
@item rectangle
w_type = 3
@end table

The window names can be passed as strings or by the @var{w_type} number.

If not all arguments are specified, the following defaults are used:
@var{win_size} = 80, @var{inc} = 24, @var{num_coef} = 64, and
@var{w_type} = 1.

@code{@var{y} = stft (@var{x}, @dots{})} returns the absolute values
of the Fourier coefficients according to the @var{num_coef} positive
frequencies.

@code{[@var{y}, @var{c}] = stft (@code{x}, @dots{})} returns the
entire STFT-matrix @var{y} and a 3-element vector @var{c} containing
the window size, increment, and window type, which is needed by the
synthesis function.
