The original "parallel" package has been extended and now contains two
independent sets of functions.

-- Functions of the original "parallel" package. Execution of
   arbitrary commands on chosen remote machines. Please see
   "README.parallel".

-- New functions. Scheduled execution of a user-supplied
   function. Please see "README.bw".

As yet, the package only contains functions for parallel execution on
a cluster of machines. For parallel execution on a single machine, see
for example "parcellfun" (author: Jaroslav Hajek) in package
"general".
