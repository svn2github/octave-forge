@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} spchol2inv (@var{u})
Invert a sparse symmetric, positive definite square matrix from its
Cholesky decomposition, @var{u}.  Note that @var{u} should be an
upper-triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements.
@code{chol2inv (@var{u})} provides @code{inv (@var{u}'*@var{u})} but
it is much faster than using @code{inv}.
