@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{h} =} hbar (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{style})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{xb}, @var{yb}] =} hbar (@dots{})
Given two vectors of x-y data, @code{bar} produces a horizontal bar graph.

If only one argument is given, it is taken as a vector of y-values
and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements.

If @var{y} is a matrix, then each column of @var{y} is taken to be a
separate bar graph plotted on the same graph. By default the columns
are plotted side-by-side. This behavior can be changed by the @var{style}
argument, which can take the values 'group' (the default), or 'stack'.

If two output arguments are specified, the data are generated but
not plotted.  For example,

@example
hbar (x, y);
@end example

@noindent
and

@example
[xb, yb] = hbar (x, y);
plot (xb, yb);
@end example

@noindent
are equivalent.
