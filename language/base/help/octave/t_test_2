@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{t}, @var{df}] =} t_test_2 (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
For two samples x and y from normal distributions with unknown means
and unknown equal variances, perform a two-sample t-test of the null
hypothesis of equal means.  Under the null, the test statistic
@var{t} follows a Student distribution with @var{df} degrees of
freedom.

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
@code{mean (@var{x}) != mean (@var{y})}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"},
the one-sided alternative @code{mean (@var{x}) > mean (@var{y})} is
used.  Similarly for @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative @code{mean
(@var{x}) < mean (@var{y})} is used.  The default is the two-sided
case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
