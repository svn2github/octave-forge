@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{c}, @var{maxsize}, @var{endian}] =} computer ()
Print or return a string of the form @var{cpu}-@var{vendor}-@var{os}
that identifies the kind of computer Octave is running on.  If invoked
with an output argument, the value is returned instead of printed.  For
example,

@example
@group
computer ()
@print{} i586-pc-linux-gnu

x = computer ()
@result{} x = "i586-pc-linux-gnu"
@end group
@end example

If two output arguments are requested, also return the maximum number
of elements for an array.

If three output arguments are requested, also return the byte order
of the current system as a character (@code{"B"} for big-endian or
@code{"L"} for little-endian).
@end deftypefn
