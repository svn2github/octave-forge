__HEADER__([[[Mailing List]]])

<p>Bugs, enhancements, and other stuff are debated on the Octave-Forge
  mailing list. It's a fairly low-trafic list, and you are most welcome
  to join. You can subscribe to the list by going to 
  <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/octave-dev">this 
  page</a>, and you can access the archives for this list <a
  href="__SOURCEFORGE__/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=33111">here</a>.
  A lot of the people on the Octave-Forge mailing list are also
  subscribed to the 
  <a href="http://www.octave.org/archive.html">
  Octave mailing lists</a>,
  so you might want to joing those lists as well. You can access a
  searchable archive for these lists 
  <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Octave-f1895.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are equally, <a href="__FORUMS__">support forums</a>
   available on the SourceForge site. However, the preferred means of
   support is through the above mailing list and so response times on
   these forums might be slow.</p>
