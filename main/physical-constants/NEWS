Summary of important user-visible changes for physicalconstants 1.0.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** VERY IMPORTANT: the physicalconstants package has been removed. Its
  only function has been moved to the miscellaneous package. To avoid
  transition problems, this new release is merely a dummy package
  dependent on the new version of the miscellaneous package.

 ** The values returned by `physical_constant' have been adjusted to the
    latest (2010) recommended values by CODATA.

 ** The function `physical_constant' has a new API and should also
    perform faster.

 ** Package is no longer automatically loaded.
