@deftypefn {Function File} {} print (@var{filename}, @var{options})
Print a graph, or save it to a file

@var{filename} defines the file name of the output file. If no
filename is specified, output is sent to the printer.

@var{options}:
@table @code
@item -P@var{printer}
  Set the @var{printer} name to which the graph is sent if no
@var{filename} is specified.
@item -color
@itemx -mono
  Monochrome or colour lines.
@item -solid
@itemx -dashed
  Solid or dashed lines.
@item -portrait
@itemx -landscape
  Plot orientation, as returned by "orient".
@item -d@var{device}
  Output device, where @var{device} is one of:
@table @code
@item ps
@itemx ps2
@itemx psc
@itemx psc2
    Postscript (level 1 and 2, mono and color)
@item eps
@itemx eps2
@itemx epsc
@itemx epsc2
    Encapsulated postscript (level 1 and 2, mono and color)
@item tex
@itemx epslatex
@itemx epslatexstandalone
@itemx pstex
@itemx pslatex
    Generate a LaTeX (or TeX) file for labels, and eps/ps for
    graphics.  The file produced by @code{epslatexstandalone} can be
    processed directly by LaTeX.  The other formats are intended to
    be included in a LaTeX (or TeX) document.  The @code{tex} device
    is the same as the @code{epslatex} device.
@item ill
@itemx aifm
    Adobe Illustrator
@item cdr
@itemx corel
    CorelDraw
@item dxf
    AutoCAD
@item emf
    Microsoft Enhanced Metafile
@item fig
    XFig.  If this format is selected the additional options
@code{-textspecial} or @code{-textnormal} can be used to control
    whether the special flag should be set for the text in the figure
    (default is @code{-textnormal}). 
@item hpgl
    HP plotter language
@item mf
    Metafont
@item png
    Portable network graphics
@item pbm
    PBMplus
@item svg
    Scalable vector graphics
@end table

  Other devices are supported by "convert" from ImageMagick.  Type
  system("convert") to see what formats are available.

  If the device is omitted, it is inferred from the file extension,
  or if there is no filename it is sent to the printer as postscript.

@itemx -S@var{xsize},@var{ysize}
  Plot size in pixels for PNG and SVG.  If using the command form of
  the print function, you must quote the @var{xsize},@var{ysize}
  option.  For example, by writing @code{"-S640,480"}.

@item -F@var{fontname}
@itemx -F@var{fontname}:@var{size}
@itemx -F:@var{size}
@var{fontname} set the postscript font (for use with postscript,
  aifm, corel and fig). By default, 'Helvetica' is set for PS/Aifm,
  and 'SwitzerlandLight' for Corel. It can also be 'Times-Roman'.
@var{size} is given in points. @var{fontname} is ignored for the
  fig device.
@end table

The filename and options can be given in any order.
