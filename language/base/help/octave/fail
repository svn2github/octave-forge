@deftypefn {Function File} {} fail (@var{code},@var{pattern})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} fail (@var{code},'warning',@var{pattern})

Return true if @var{code} fails with an error message matching
@var{pattern}, otherwise produce an error. Note that @var{code}
is a string and if @var{code} runs successfully, the error produced is:

@example
          expected error but got none  
@end example

If the code fails with a different error, the message produced is:

@example
          expected <pattern>
          but got <text of actual error>
@end example

The angle brackets are not part of the output.

Called with three arguments, the behavior is similar to 
@code{fail(@var{code}, @var{pattern})}, but produces an error if no 
warning is given during code execution or if the code fails.

@end deftypefn
