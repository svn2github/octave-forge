using a null-space active-set method.

Any bound (@var{A}, @var{b}, @var{lb}, @var{ub}, @var{A_lb},
@var{A_ub}) may be set to the empty matrix (@code{[]}) if not
present.  If the initial guess is feasible the algorithm is faster.

The value @var{info} is a structure with the following fields:
@table @code
@item solveiter
The number of iterations required to find the solution.
@item info
An integer indicating the status of the solution, as follows:
@table @asis
@item 0
The problem is feasible and convex.  Global solution found.
@item 1
The problem is not convex.  Local solution found.
@item 2
The problem is not convex and unbounded.
@item 3
Maximum number of iterations reached.
@item 6
The problem is infeasible.
