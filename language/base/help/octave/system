@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} system (@var{string}, @var{return_output}, @var{type})
Execute a shell command specified by @var{string}.  The second
argument is optional.  If @var{type} is @code{"async"}, the process
is started in the background and the process id of the child process
is returned immediately.  Otherwise, the process is started, and
Octave waits until it exits.  If @var{type} argument is omitted, a
value of @code{"sync"} is assumed.

If two input arguments are given (the actual value of
@var{return_output} is irrelevant) and the subprocess is started
synchronously, or if @var{system} is called with one input argument and
one or more output arguments, the output from the command is returned.
Otherwise, if the subprocess is executed synchronously, its output is
sent to the standard output.  To send the output of a command executed
with @var{system} through the pager, use a command like

@example
disp (system (cmd, 1));
@end example

@noindent
or

@example
printf ("%s
", system (cmd, 1));
@end example

The @code{system} function can return two values.  The first is the
exit status of the command and the second is any output from the
command that was written to the standard output stream.  For example,

@example
[status, output] = system ("echo foo; exit 2");
@end example

@noindent
will set the variable @code{output} to the string @samp{foo}, and the
variable @code{status} to the integer @samp{2}.
@end deftypefn
