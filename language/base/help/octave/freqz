@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{h}, @var{w}] =} freqz (@var{b}, @var{a}, @var{n}, "whole")
Return the complex frequency response @var{h} of the rational IIR filter
whose numerator and denominator coefficients are @var{b} and @var{a},
respectively.  The response is evaluated at @var{n} angular frequencies
between 0 and
@ifinfo
 2*pi.
@end ifinfo
@iftex
@tex
 $2\pi$.
@end tex
@end iftex

@noindent
The output value @var{w} is a vector of the frequencies.

If the fourth argument is omitted, the response is evaluated at
frequencies between 0 and
@ifinfo
 pi.
@end ifinfo
@iftex
@tex
 $\pi$.
@end tex
@end iftex

If @var{n} is omitted, a value of 512 is assumed.

If @var{a} is omitted, the denominator is assumed to be 1 (this
corresponds to a simple FIR filter).

For fastest computation, @var{n} should factor into a small number of
small primes.

@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{h} =} freqz (@var{b}, @var{a}, @var{w})
Evaluate the response at the specific frequencies in the vector @var{w}.
The values for @var{w} are measured in radians.

@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@dots{}] =} freqz (@dots{}, @var{Fs})
Return frequencies in Hz instead of radians assuming a sampling rate
@var{Fs}.  If you are evaluating the response at specific frequencies 
@var{w}, those frequencies should be requested in Hz rather than radians.

@deftypefnx {Function File} {} freqz (@dots{})
Plot the pass band, stop band and phase response of @var{h} rather
than returning them.
@end deftypefn
