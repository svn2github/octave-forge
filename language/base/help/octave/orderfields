@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {[@var{t}, @var{p}] =} orderfields (@var{s1}, @var{s2})
Return a struct with fields arranged alphabetically or as specified
by @var{s2} and a corresponding permutation vector.

Given one struct, arrange field names in @var{s1} alphabetically.

Given two structs, arrange field names in @var{s1} as they appear
in @var{s2}.  The second argument may also specify the order in
a permutation vector or a cell array of strings.
