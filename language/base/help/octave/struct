@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} struct ("field", @var{value}, "field", @var{value}, @dots{})

Create a structure and initialize its value.

If the values are cell arrays, create a structure array and initialize
its values.  The dimensions of each cell array of values must match.
Singleton cells and non-cell values are repeated so that they fill
the entire array.  If the cells are empty, create an empty structure
array with the specified field names.
