@deftypefn {Function File} {} interpft (@var{x}, @var{n})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} interpft (@var{x}, @var{n}, @var{dim})

Fourier interpolation. If @var{x} is a vector, then @var{x} is
resampled with @var{n} points. The data in @var{x} is assumed to be
equispaced. If @var{x} is an array, then operate along each column of
the array seperately. If @var{dim} is specified, then interpolate
along the dimension @var{dim}.

@code{interpft} assumes that the interpolated function is periodic,
and so assumption are made about the end points of the inetrpolation.
