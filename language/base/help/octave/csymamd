For a symmetric positive definite matrix @var{s}, returns the permutation
vector @var{p} such that @code{@var{s}(@var{p},@var{p})} tends to have a
sparser Cholesky factor than @var{s}. Sometimes @code{csymamd} works well
for symmetric indefinite matrices too. The matrix @var{s} is assumed to
be symmetric; only the strictly lower triangular part is referenced.
@var{s} must be square. The ordering is followed by an elimination tree
post-ordering.

@var{knobs} is an optional one- to three-element input vector, with a
default value of @code{[10 1 0]} if present or empty.  Entries not
present are set to their defaults.

@table @code
@item @var{knobs}(1)
If @var{s} is n-by-n, then rows and columns with more than
@code{max(16,@var{knobs}(1)*sqrt(n))} entries are ignored, and ordered
last in the output permutation (subject to the cmember constraints).

@item @var{knobs}(2)
If nonzero, aggressive absorption is performed.

@item @var{knobs}(3)
If nonzero, statistics and knobs are printed.

@end table

@var{cmember} is an optional vector of length n. It defines the constraints
on the ordering. If @code{@var{cmember}(j) = @var{s}}, then row/column j is
in constraint set @var{c} (@var{c} must be in the range 1 to n). In the
output permutation @var{p}, rows/columns in set 1 appear first, followed
by all rows/columns in set 2, and so on. @code{@var{cmember} = ones(1,n)}
if not present or empty. @code{csymamd(@var{s},[],1:n)} returns @code{1:n}.

@code{@var{p} = csymamd(@var{s})} is about the same as @code{@var{p} =
symamd(@var{s})}. @var{knobs} and its default values differ.

@code{@var{stats} (4:7)} provide information if CCOLAMD was able to
continue. The matrix is OK if @code{@var{stats} (4)} is zero, or 1 if
invalid. @code{@var{stats} (5)} is the rightmost column index that is
unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.
@code{@var{stats} (6)} is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row
index in the column index given by @code{@var{stats} (5)}, or zero if no
such row index exists. @code{@var{stats} (7)} is the number of duplicate
or out-of-order row indices. @code{@var{stats} (8:20)} is always zero in
the current version of CCOLAMD (reserved for future use).
