@cindex Hessenberg decomposition
Compute the Hessenberg decomposition of the matrix @var{a}.

The Hessenberg decomposition is usually used as the first step in an
eigenvalue computation, but has other applications as well (see Golub,
Nash, and Van Loan, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 1979).  The
Hessenberg decomposition is
@iftex
@tex
$$
A = PHP^T
$$
where $P$ is a square unitary matrix ($P^HP = I$), and $H$
is upper Hessenberg ($H_{i,j} = 0, \forall i \ge j+1$).
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@code{p * h * p' = a} where @code{p} is a square unitary matrix
(@code{p' * p = I}, using complex-conjugate transposition) and @code{h}
is upper Hessenberg (@code{i >= j+1 => h (i, j) = 0}).
@end ifinfo
@end deftypefn
