@deftypefn {function File} {[@var{b}, @var{c}]} = spdiags (@var{a})
@deftypefnx {function File} {@var{b}} = spdiags (@var{a}, @var{c})
@deftypefnx {function File} {@var{b}} = spdiags (@var{v}, @var{c}, @var{a})
@deftypefnx {function File} {@var{b}} = spdiags (@var{v}, @var{c}, @var{m}, @var{n})
A generalization of the function @code{spdiag}. Called with a single
input argument, the non-zero diagonals @var{c} of @var{A} are extracted.
With two arguments the diagonals to extract are given by the vector 
@var{c}.

The other two forms of @code{spdiags} modify the input matrix by
replacing the diagonals. They use the columns of @var{v} to replace
the columns represented by the vector @var{c}. If the sparse matrix
@var{a} is defined then the diagonals of this matrix are replaced.
Otherwise a matrix of @var{m} by @var{n} is created with the
diagonals given by @var{v}.

Negative values of @var{c} representive diagonals below the main
diagonal, and positive values of @var{c} diagonals above the main
diagonal.

For example

@example
@group
spdiags (reshape (1:12, 4, 3), [-1 0 1], 5, 4)
@result{}    5 10  0  0
      1  6 11  0
      0  2  7 12
      0  0  3  8
      0  0  0  4
