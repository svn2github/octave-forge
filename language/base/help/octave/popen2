@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{in}, @var{out}, @var{pid}] =} popen2 (@var{command}, @var{args})
Start a subprocess with two-way communication.  The name of the process
is given by @var{command}, and @var{args} is an array of strings
containing options for the command.  The file identifiers for the input
and output streams of the subprocess are returned in @var{in} and
@var{out}.  If execution of the command is successful, @var{pid}
contains the process ID of the subprocess.  Otherwise, @var{pid} is
@minus{}1.

For example,

@example
@group
[in, out, pid] = popen2 ("sort", "-nr");
fputs (in, "these\nare\nsome\nstrings\n");
fclose (in);
EAGAIN = errno ("EAGAIN");
done = false;
do
  s = fgets (out);
  if (ischar (s))
    fputs (stdout, s);
  elseif (errno () == EAGAIN)
    sleep (0.1);
    fclear (out);
  else
    done = true;
  endif
until (done)
fclose (out);
@print{} are
@print{} some
@print{} strings
@print{} these
@end group
@end example
