@deftypefn {Function File} {} spearman (@var{x}, @var{y})
Compute Spearman's rank correlation coefficient @var{rho} for each of
the variables specified by the input arguments.

For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a variable;
vectors are always observations and may be row or column vectors.

@code{spearman (@var{x})} is equivalent to @code{spearman (@var{x},
@var{x})}.

For two data vectors @var{x} and @var{y}, Spearman's @var{rho} is the
correlation of the ranks of @var{x} and @var{y}.

If @var{x} and @var{y} are drawn from independent distributions,
@var{rho} has zero mean and variance @code{1 / (n - 1)}, and is
asymptotically normally distributed.
