@deftypefn {Function File} {} rot90 (@var{x}, @var{n})
Return a copy of @var{x} with the elements rotated counterclockwise in
90-degree increments.  The second argument is optional, and specifies
how many 90-degree rotations are to be applied (the default value is 1).
Negative values of @var{n} rotate the matrix in a clockwise direction.
For example,

@example
@group
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1)
@result{}  3  1
         4  2
@end group
@end example

@noindent
rotates the given matrix clockwise by 90 degrees.  The following are all
equivalent statements:

@example
@group
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1)
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 3)
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 7)
@end group
@end example

Due to the difficulty of defining an axis about which to rotate the 
matrix @code{rot90} only work with 2-D arrays.  To rotate N-d arrays
use @code{rotdim} instead.
