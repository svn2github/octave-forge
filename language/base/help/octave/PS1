Query or set the primary prompt string.  When executing interactively,
Octave displays the primary prompt when it is ready to read a command.

The default value of the primary prompt string is @code{"\s:\#> "}.
To change it, use a command like

@example
octave:13> PS1 = "\\u@@\\H> "
@end example

@noindent
which will result in the prompt @samp{boris@@kremvax> } for the user
@samp{boris} logged in on the host @samp{kremvax.kgb.su}.  Note that two
backslashes are required to enter a backslash into a double-quoted
character string.
