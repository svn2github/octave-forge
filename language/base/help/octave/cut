@deftypefn {Function File} {} cut (@var{x}, @var{breaks})
Create categorical data out of numerical or continuous data by
cutting into intervals.

If @var{breaks} is a scalar, the data is cut into that many
equal-width intervals.  If @var{breaks} is a vector of break points,
the category has @code{length (@var{breaks}) - 1} groups.

The returned value is a vector of the same size as @var{x} telling
which group each point in @var{x} belongs to.  Groups are labelled
from 1 to the number of groups; points outside the range of
@var{breaks} are labelled by @code{NaN}.
