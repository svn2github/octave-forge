@deftypefn {Function File} {} polyvalm (@var{c}, @var{x})
Evaluate a polynomial in the matrix sense.

@code{polyvalm (@var{c}, @var{x})} will evaluate the polynomial in the
matrix sense, i.e. matrix multiplication is used instead of element by
element multiplication as is used in polyval.

The argument @var{x} must be a square matrix.
