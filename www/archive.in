__HEADER__([[[Mailing list]]])

<p>Bugs, enhancements, and other stuff are debated on the Octave-Forge
  mailing list. It's a fairly low-trafic list, and you are most welcome
  to join. You can subscribe to the list by going to 
  <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/octave-dev">this page</a>.
  On the same page you can also find archives of the mailing list. A lot
  of the people on the Octave-Forge mailing list are also subscribed to the
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/archive.html">Octave mailing lists</a>,
  so you might want to joing those lists as well.</p>

<p>There are equally, <a href="__FORUMS__">support forums</a>
   available on the SourceForge site. However, the preferred means of
   support is through the above mailing list and so response times on
   these forums might be slow.</p>
