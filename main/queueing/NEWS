Summary of important user-visible changes for queueing-1.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** queueing-1.2.0 includes bug fixes and new features

** The documentation has been restructured, hopefully improving
   readability and overall organization

** Fixed bugs in various functions (qncmva, qnconvolution,
   qnconvolutionld and qnclosedmultimva)

** Functions qnclosedab(), qnopenab(), qnclosedbsb() and qnopenbsb()
   got a new common interface similar to that of qnclosedsinglemva()
   and qnclosedmultimva()
   
** Asymptotic and balanced system bounds can now be computed also for
   multiclass networks

** New function qnclosedmulticb() for computing Composite Bounds for
   multiclass networks

** Functions qnclosedpb and qnclosedgb have been deprecated and renamed to
   qnclosedsinglepb and qnclosedsinglegp, respectively


Summary of important user-visible changes for queueing-1.1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** queueing-1.1.1 is a bug fix release

** Increased tolerance in tests for dtmc_fpt and dtmc_mtta to avoid
   spurious failures on some platforms

** Set "Autoload: no" in the DESCRIPTION file. This means that this
   package is no longer automatically loaded on Octave startup. To use
   the queueing package you need to issue the command "pkg load
   queueing" at the Octave prompt.


Summary of important user-visible changes for queueing-1.1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** Function ctmc_exps() can now compute the expected sojourn time
   until absorption for absorbing CTMC

** Functions ctmc_exps() and ctmc_taexps() now accept a scalar as
   the second argument (time). 

** Function ctmc_bd() now returns the infinitesimal generator matrix Q
   of the birth-death process with given rates, not the steady-state
   solution.

** The following new functions have been added: dtmc_bd(), dtmc_mtta(), 
   ctmc_check_Q(), dtmc_exps(), dtmc_taexps()

** The following deprecated functions have been removed: ctmc_bd_solve(),
   ctmc_solve(), dtmc_solve()
