@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} keyboard (@var{prompt})
This function is normally used for simple debugging.  When the
@code{keyboard} function is executed, Octave prints a prompt and waits
for user input.  The input strings are then evaluated and the results
are printed.  This makes it possible to examine the values of variables
within a function, and to assign new values to variables.  No value is
returned from the @code{keyboard} function, and it continues to prompt
for input until the user types @samp{quit}, or @samp{exit}.

If @code{keyboard} is invoked without any arguments, a default prompt of
@samp{debug> } is used.
