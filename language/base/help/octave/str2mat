@deftypefn {Function File} {} str2mat (@var{s_1}, @dots{}, @var{s_n})
Return a matrix containing the strings @var{s_1}, @dots{}, @var{s_n} as
its rows.  Each string is padded with blanks in order to form a valid
matrix.

This function is modelled after @sc{Matlab}.  In Octave, you can create
a matrix of strings by @code{[@var{s_1}; @dots{}; @var{s_n}]} even if
the strings are not all the same length.
