Octave/mingw32 3.2.3-2 new features, changes and bugfixes (from 3.2.3)
====================================================================

*) CHG: Remove SSE3 ATLAS libraries from installer as they reportedly
        segfault on complex arithmetic. No solution available yet.
*) FIX: Fix a bug in patch of jpeg-7 which caused loading jpeg images to fail
*) FIX: Fix a bug in installer setting wrong shortcuts to octave documentation
*) FIX: Fix missing gnuplot documentation in installer


Octave/mingw32 3.2.3 new features, changes and bugfixes (from 3.2.2)
====================================================================

*) CHG: Build with gcc-4.4.0 from http://www.mingw.org
*) CHG: Update to gnuplot 4.3.0-2009-07-08 CVS snapshot
*) FIX: for gnuplot, add a workaround patch to SF#2848002
*) CHG: build gnuplot with support for wxwidgets terminal. To use it, set the
        environment variable GNUTERM to "wxt", e.g. from within octave execute
            putenv("GNUTERM","wxt")
*) CHG: Build Graphicsmagick as relocatable dll and remove dependency on 
        environment variable defining installation location
*) CHG: Update several dependency libraries
*) CHG: Add SSE/SSE2-enabled fftw3 library
*) CHG: add the fixed-0.7.10 octave forge package to installer
*) FIX: Printing to pdf no longer yields spurious empty pages using gnuplot
*) FIX: Pressing CTRL-C within octave should no longer crash gnuplot
*) FIX: the command "clear all" no longer segfaults after calling eigs()


Octave/mingw32 3.2.0 new features, changes and bugfixes (from 3.2.0)
====================================================================

*) CHG: The 3.2.2 installer includes the following post-3.2.2 changesets in 
	addition to the octave-3.2.2 sources
   
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/cd95695a0a89  ("dir" crashes)
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/b308b2e12f04  (16bit images)
      http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-2-x/rev/9107c882f193  (speed up "plot")
      
   These adress bugfixes relevant to mingw32 platform.
   These will be included by default in succeeding versions of octave/mingw32.

*) CHG: The installer includes a Q16 GraphicsMagick build (configured 
        with --quantum-depth=16) to enable lossless reading/writing of
        16bit images.

*) CHG: The following octave-forge packages have been marked as "-noauto":
      windows-1.0.8
      octcdf-1.0.13
      communications-1.0.10
      ga-0.9.7
   
   This is done to avoid the "clear all" crash if any of these packages
   is selected during the installation. If you require them to be loaded 
   automatically you have to manually set them to, by executing the 
   command(s)
   
      pkg rebuild -auto windows
      pkg rebuild -auto octcdf
      pkg rebuild -auto communications
      pkg rebuild -auto ga
   
   from the octave prompt.
   
   Be advised that this will trigger the "clear all" segfault!

*) FIX: The command "dir" should no longer crash on Windows Vista and Windows 
        Server
*) FIX: Reading/writing images using GraphicsMagick no longer fails with 
        GraphicsMagick complaining about missing configuration files.
*) FIX: Reading/writing 16bit images works without loss of precision
