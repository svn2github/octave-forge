@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{t}, @var{df}] =} t_test (@var{x}, @var{m}, @var{alt})
For a sample @var{x} from a normal distribution with unknown mean and
variance, perform a t-test of the null hypothesis @code{mean
(@var{x}) == @var{m}}.  Under the null, the test statistic @var{t}
follows a Student distribution with @code{@var{df} = length (@var{x})
- 1} degrees of freedom.

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
@code{mean (@var{x}) != @var{m}}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
one-sided alternative @code{mean (@var{x}) > @var{m}} is considered.
Similarly for @var{"<"}, the one-sided alternative @code{mean
(@var{x}) < @var{m}} is considered,  The default is the two-sided
case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
