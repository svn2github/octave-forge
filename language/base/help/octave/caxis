@deftypefn {Function File} {} caxis (@var{limits})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} caxis (@var{h}, @dots{})
Set color axis limits for plots.

The argument @var{limits} should be a 2 element vector specifying the 
lower and upper limits to assign to the first and last value in the
colormap. Values outside this range are clamped to the first and last
colormap entries. 

If @var{limits} is 'auto', then automatic colormap scaling is applied,
whereas if @var{limits} is 'manual' the colormap scaling is set to manual.

Called without any arguments to current color axis limits are returned.

If an axes handle is passed as the first argument, then operate on
this axes rather than the current axes.
