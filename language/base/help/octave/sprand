@deftypefn {Function File} {} sprand (@var{m}, @var{n}, @var{d})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} sprand (@var{s})
Generate a random sparse matrix. The size of the matrix will be
@var{m} by @var{n}, with a density of values given by @var{d}.
@var{d} should be between 0 and 1. Values will be uniformly
distributed between 0 and 1.

Note: sometimes the actual density  may be a bit smaller than @var{d}. 
This is unlikely to happen for large really sparse matrices.

If called with a single matrix argument, a random sparse matrix is
generated wherever the matrix @var{S} is non-zero.
