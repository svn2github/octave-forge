@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} completion_matches (@var{hint})
Generate possible completions given @var{hint}.

This function is provided for the benefit of programs like Emacs which
might be controlling Octave and handling user input.  The current
command number is not incremented when this function is called.  This is
a feature, not a bug.
