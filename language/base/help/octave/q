@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{q} =} quantile (@var{x}, @var{p})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{q} =} quantile (@var{x}, @var{p}, @var{dim})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{q} =} quantile (@var{x}, @var{p}, @var{dim}, @var{method})
For a sample, @var{x}, calculate the quantiles, @var{q}, corresponding to
the cumulative probability values in @var{p}.  All non-numeric values (NaNs) of
@var{x} are ignored.

If @var{x} is a matrix, compute the quantiles for each column and
return them in a matrix, such that the i-th row of @var{q} contains
the @var{p}(i)th quantiles of each column of @var{x}.

The optional argument @var{dim} determines the dimension along which 
the percentiles are calculated.  If @var{dim} is omitted, and @var{x} is
a vector or matrix, it defaults to 1 (column wise quantiles).  In the 
instance that @var{x} is a N-d array, @var{dim} defaults to the first 
dimension whose size greater than unity.

The methods available to calculate sample quantiles are the nine methods
used by R (http://www.r-project.org/).  The default value is METHOD = 5.

Discontinuous sample quantile methods 1, 2, and 3

@enumerate 1
@item Method 1: Inverse of empirical distribution function.
@item Method 2: Similar to method 1 but with averaging at discontinuities.
@item Method 3: SAS definition: nearest even order statistic.
@end enumerate

Continuous sample quantile methods 4 through 9, where p(k) is the linear
interpolation function respecting each methods' representative cdf.

@enumerate 4
@item Method 4: p(k) = k / n. That is, linear interpolation of the empirical cdf.
@item Method 5: p(k) = (k - 0.5) / n. That is a piecewise linear function where 
the knots are the values midway through the steps of the empirical cdf. 
@item Method 6: p(k) = k / (n + 1).
@item Method 7: p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1).
@item Method 8: p(k) = (k - 1/3) / (n + 1/3).  The resulting quantile estimates 
are approximately median-unbiased regardless of the distribution of @var{x}.
@item Method 9: p(k) = (k - 3/8) / (n + 1/4).  The resulting quantile estimates 
are approximately unbiased for the expected order statistics if @var{x} is 
normally distributed.
@end enumerate

Hyndman and Fan (1996) recommend method 8.  Maxima, S, and R
(versions prior to 2.0.0) use 7 as their default.  Minitab and SPSS
use method 6.  @sc{matlab} uses method 5.
