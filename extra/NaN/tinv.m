function y = tinv(x,n);
% TINV returns inverse cumulative function of the student distribution
%
% x = tinv(p,v);
%
% Computes the quantile (inverse of the CDF) of a the student
%    cumulative distribution with mean m and standard deviation s
% p,v must be matrices of same size, or any one can be a scalar.
