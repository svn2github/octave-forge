@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{y}} = shiftdim (@var{x}, @var{n})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{y}, @var{ns}]} = shiftdim (@var{x})
Shifts the dimension of @var{x} by @var{n}, where @var{n} must be
an integer scalar. When @var{n} is positive, the dimensions of
@var{x} are shifted to the left, with the leading dimensions
circulated to the end. If @var{n} is negative, then the dimensions
of @var{x} are shifted to the right, with @var{n} leading singleton
dimensions added.

Called with a single argument, @code{shiftdim}, removes the leading
singleton dimensions, returning the number of dimensions removed
in the second output argument @var{ns}.

For example 

@example
@group
x = ones (1, 2, 3);
size (shiftdim (x, -1))
@result{} [1, 1, 2, 3]
size (shiftdim (x, 1))
@result{} [2, 3]
[b, ns] = shiftdim (x);
@result{} b =  [1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1]
@result{} ns = 1
@end group
