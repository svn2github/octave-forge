  ## This is a transform based entirely on the simplified complex-valued transform
  ## in the Mathias paper, page 10. My problem with the code as it stands is, it
  ## doesn't have a good way of determining the window size. Sigma is currently up
  ## to the user, and sigma determines the window width (but that might be best.)
  ##
  ## Currently the code does not apply a time-shift, which needs to be fixed so
  ## that it will work correctly over given frequencies.
	 
  transform = cell(noctave*ncoeff,1);
  
  for octave_iter = 1:noctave
    ## In fastnu.c, winrad is set as Ï€/(sigma*omegaoct); I suppose this is
    ## ... feasible, although it will need to be noted that if sigma is set too
    ## large, the windows will exclude data. I can work with that.
    ##
    ## An additional consideration is that 
    
    for coeff_iter = 1:ncoeff
	
      ## in this, win_t is the centre of the window in question
      ## Although that will vary depending on the window. This is just an
      ## implementation for the first window.
