## this function removes the PKG_ADD script from the .oct directory of the io
## package after installation. The reason is that PKG_ADD calls chk_spreadsheet_support
## which belongs to the io package itself. While it is ok when called from the
## .m directory (since chk_spreadsheet_support is there), when called from the
## .oct directory it fails since the package hasn't been loaded yet
