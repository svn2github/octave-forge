@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {@var{val} =} EXEC_PATH ()
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {@var{old_val} =} EXEC_PATH (@var{new_val})
Query or set the internal variable that specifies a colon separated
list of directories to search when executing external programs.
Its initial value is taken from the environment variable
@code{OCTAVE_EXEC_PATH} (if it exists) or @code{PATH}, but that
value can be overridden by the command line argument
@code{--exec-path PATH}.  At startup, an additional set of
directories (including the shell PATH) is appended to the path
specified in the environment or on the command line.  If you use
the @code{EXEC_PATH} function to modify the path, you should take
care to preserve these additional directories.
