As of this writing, the version of SWIG supporting Octave hasn't yet 
been released. You'll need to go download and build it yourself from 
SWIG's SVN repository. See 
http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=1645
http://octave-swig.sourceforge.net/

To build the bindings, run:
make

To run the tests, run:
make check

-- Maintainer Notes

The *_filtered.h files are system headers w/ very minor changes (a few 
#ifndef SWIG ... #endif), such that they are easy to keep current w/
diff/patch/whatever.

The postgres tests require that postgres is installed, a user 
testuser/secret exists, and a database named testdb exists.

The mysql tests require that mysql is setup, a user/pwd root/secret 
exists, and a database named testdb exists.

The odbc tests require that postgres and its odbc driver are installed, 
and that a DSN named testdb exists.
