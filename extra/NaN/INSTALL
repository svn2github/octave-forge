Installing the NaN-tb with Octave:
----------------------------------
a) extract files from NaNnnn.tar.gz and move them into 
.../octave/.../m/statistics/base/ 

b) Alternatively, the files can be moved into any other directory; but you 
must remove from .../octave/.../m/statistics/base/ 
mean.m, meansq.m, median.m, moment.m, skewness.m, kurtosis.m, std.m, var.m
and from .../source_forge/.../statistics/*
zscore.m, mad.m, geomean.m, harmmean.m 

(Optional) You can remove nansum, nanmean, nanmedian, etc. because you do not need 
them anymore. 

c) (Re-)start Octave and run NANINSTTEST. 
This checks whether the installation was successful. 


Installing the NaN-tb for Matlab:
----------------------------------
a) Extract files and save them in /your/directory/structure/to/NaN/

b) Include the following command. 
	path('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/',path)
at the end of your startup.m. 

c) (Re-)start Matlab and run NANINSTTEST. 
This checks whether the installation was successful. 

d) [OPTIONAL]: 
  To improve speed, you can used compiled versions of SUMSKIPNAN
  - MATLAB: compile the C-Mex-function SUMSKIPNAN.CPP
    mex sumskipnan.cpp
  - OCTAVE: compile the Oct-function SUMSKIPNAN.CC
    mkoctfile sumskipnan.cc    
  Run NANINSTTEST again to check the stability of the compiled SUMSKIPNAN.  

e) HINT: if the MEX/OCT-file of SUMSKIPNAN causes problems, you can remove it savely. 
Then the (slower) M-file is used.
