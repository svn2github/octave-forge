Draw a Pareto chart, also called ABC chart. A Pareto chart is a bar graph 
used to arrange information in such a way that priorities for process 
improvement can be established. It organizes and displays information 
to show the relative importance of data. The chart is similar to the 
histogram or bar chart, except that the bars are arranged in decreasing 
order from left to right along the abscissa.

The fundamental idea (Pareto principle) behind the use of Pareto 
diagrams is that the majority of an effect is due to a small subset of the
causes, so for quality improvement the first few (as presented on the 
diagram) contributing causes to a problem usually account for the majority 
of the result. Thus, targeting these "major causes" for elimination 
results in the most cost-effective improvement scheme.

The data are passed as @var{x} and the abscissa as @var{y}. If @var{y} is
absent, then the abscissa are assumed to be @code{1 : length (@var{x})}.
@var{y} can be a string array, a cell array of strings or a numerical
vector.

An example of the use of @code{pareto} is

@example
@group
Cheese = @{"Cheddar", "Swiss", "Camembert", "Munster", "Stilton", ...
   "Blue"@};
Sold = [105, 30, 70, 10, 15, 20];
pareto(Sold, Cheese);
@end group
@end example
@end deftypefn
