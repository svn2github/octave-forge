Return a matrix or N-dimensional array whose elements are all eps,
the machine precision.  More precisely, @code{eps} is the largest
relative spacing between any two adjacent numbers in the machine's
floating point system.  This number is obviously system-dependent.  On
machines that support 64 bit IEEE floating point arithmetic, @code{eps}
is approximately
