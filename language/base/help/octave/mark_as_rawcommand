@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} mark_as_rawcommand (@var{name})
Enter @var{name} into the list of raw input commands and to the list of
command style functions.
Raw input commands are like normal command style functions, but they
receive their input unprocessed (ie. strings still contain the quotes
and escapes they had when input). However, comments and continuations
are handled as usual, you cannot pass a token starting with a comment
character ('#' or '%') to your function, and the last token cannot be
a continuation token ('\' or '...').
