@defvr {Built-in Variable} warn_function_name_clash
If the value of @code{warn_function_name_clash} is nonzero, a warning is
issued when Octave finds that the name of a function defined in a
function file differs from the name of the file.  (If the names
disagree, the name declared inside the file is ignored.)  If the value
is 0, the warning is omitted.  The default value is 1.
