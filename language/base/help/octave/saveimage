@deftypefn {Function File} {} saveimage (@var{file}, @var{x}, @var{fmt}, @var{map})
Save the matrix @var{x} to @var{file} in image format @var{fmt}.  Valid
values for @var{fmt} are

@table @code
@item "img"
Octave's image format.  The current colormap is also saved in the file.

@item "ppm"
Portable pixmap format.

@item "ps"
PostScript format.  Note that images saved in PostScript format can not
be read back into Octave with loadimage.
@end table

If the fourth argument is supplied, the specified colormap will also be
saved along with the image.

Note: if the colormap contains only two entries and these entries are
black and white, the bitmap ppm and PostScript formats are used.  If the
image is a gray scale image (the entries within each row of the colormap
are equal) the gray scale ppm and PostScript image formats are used,
otherwise the full color formats are used.
