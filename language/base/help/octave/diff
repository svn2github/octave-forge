@deftypefn {Function File} {} diff (@var{x}, @var{k}, @var{dim})
If @var{x} is a vector of length @var{n}, @code{diff (@var{x})} is the
vector of first differences
@iftex
@tex
 $x_2 - x_1, \ldots{}, x_n - x_{n-1}$.
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@var{x}(2) - @var{x}(1), @dots{}, @var{x}(n) - @var{x}(n-1).
@end ifinfo

If @var{x} is a matrix, @code{diff (@var{x})} is the matrix of column
differences along the first non-singleton dimension.

The second argument is optional.  If supplied, @code{diff (@var{x},
@var{k})}, where @var{k} is a nonnegative integer, returns the
@var{k}-th differences. It is possible that @var{k} is larger than
then first non-singleton dimension of the matrix. In this case,
@code{diff} continues to take the differences along the next
non-singleton dimension.

The dimension along which to take the difference can be explicitly
stated with the optional variable @var{dim}. In this case the 
@var{k}-th order differences are calculated along this dimension.
In the case where @var{k} exceeds @code{size (@var{x}, @var{dim})}
then an empty matrix is returned.
