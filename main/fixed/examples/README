This directory contains a few short examples of the use of the
fixed point class within octave. 

Makefile	: The makefile for the example oct-files
fixed_inc.cc	: A simple example of accessing the fixed point structures
			in an oct-file
ffft.cc		: An example of a radix-4 fft implemented in fixed point
ffft.h		: The header file associated with ffft.c
testofdm.m	: A script file to test the fixed-point radix-4 fft using
			the example of an OFDM modulator
testfixed.m	: A simple example of a function that uses fixed versus
			floating inputs to a function that is not specifically
			fixed point. READ the doc about using "[]" !!!

The file ../fixedpoint.m should also be examined as an example of the
use of the fixed point type within octave rather than as oct-files.
