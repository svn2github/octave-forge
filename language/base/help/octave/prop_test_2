@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{z}] =} prop_test_2 (@var{x1}, @var{n1}, @var{x2}, @var{n2}, @var{alt})
If @var{x1} and @var{n1} are the counts of successes and trials in
one sample, and @var{x2} and @var{n2} those in a second one, test the
null hypothesis that the success probabilities @var{p1} and @var{p2}
are the same.  Under the null, the test statistic @var{z}
approximately follows a standard normal distribution.

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
@code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
@var{p1} != @var{p2}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the one-sided
alternative @var{p1} > @var{p2} is used.  Similarly for @code{"<"},
the one-sided alternative @var{p1} < @var{p2} is used.
The default is the two-sided case.

The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
