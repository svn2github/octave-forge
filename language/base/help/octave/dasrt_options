@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} dasrt_options (@var{opt}, @var{val})
When called with two arguments, this function
allows you set options parameters for the function @code{dasrt}.
Given one argument, @code{dasrt_options} returns the value of the
corresponding option.  If no arguments are supplied, the names of all
the available options and their current values are displayed.

Options include

@table @code
@item "absolute tolerance"
Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it
must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.
@item "relative tolerance"
Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it
must match the dimension of the state vector, and the absolute
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

The local error test applied at each integration step is
@example
  abs (local error in x(i)) <= rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)
@end example
@item "initial step size"
Differential-algebraic problems may occaisionally suffer from severe
scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal
about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this
problem by specifying an initial stepsize.
@item "maximum order"
Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must
be between 1 and 5, inclusive.
@item "maximum step size"
Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large
regions.
@item "step limit"
Maximum number of integration steps to attempt on a single call to the
underlying Fortran code.
@end table
