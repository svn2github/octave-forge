<p>Have you got Cygwin installed?<br>
<ul>
<li>No: go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2888">Octave-Forge</a>,
grab the file octave-2.1.42-windows-noatlas.exe (look under octave-forge-windows / octave-2.1.42-windows), 
doubleclick on the file and give the right answers (it's not difficult).</li>
<li>Yes: go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2888">Octave-Forge</a>, 
grab the file octave-2.1.42-gnuplot-octaveforge-noatlas.tar.bz2 (look under octave-forge-windows / octave-2.1.42-cygwin)
and untar/gunzip it into place in your Cygwin, or let Cygwin setup do this for you.</li>
</ul>
If you know what you are doing - OK.<br>
If you found out too late that you didn't, you can read around in this web page to search for answers.<br>
If you feel that more subtle and optimal choices must be feasible (true), you can also read on.<br>
Good luck!

<p><a NAME="Why_and_whom"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>1. Why
this document and for who is it intended?</font></font></b>
<p><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Why?</font></font></u>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Because, according to the constant influx
of help-needed-for-Octave-under-Windows-installation messages on the help-octave
mailing list, many Windows users would like to use Octave but:</font></font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>are reluctant to learn and/or install
Linux, or</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>have inadequate PC knowledge to get difficult
programs installed themselves, or</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>run into unexpected problems imposed by
silently imposed Windows standards or interference from silently installed
Windows programs, or</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>simply do not know where to collect enough
info to solve their Octave-for-Windows problems themselves.</font></font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>And because I also have struggled a bit
with the Windows installation, did not give up but delved a bit deeper
into it. I thought that my experience could help others getting Octave
to run under Windows. Besides, now and then I got some spare time left
to document it all.</font></font></li>
</ul>

<u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>For who?</font></font></u>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>This document is intended as an aid
for those souls having trouble setting up or running their Octave version
under Windows and who cannot find any clue as to how they can solve their
problems. This does not imply that all solutions to all problems can be
found here; but at least I have described several ways to set up Octave
from scratch, all of which demand a bit a bit of forethought, reading and
work, but probably bear the least risk of problems. Of those methods, <b>2</b>
(<a href="#Overview">see below</a> ) is IMHO currently the best and thus recommended.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Given the fact that installation of
Octave under Windows has some tricky aspects, potential Octave-for-Windows
users should realize the following:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Octave is certainly <b>not</b> a native
Windows program, it is rather much more Linux/Unix-like. It will help a
lot if you learn yourself some basic Linux usage once you get to know Octave
better. This amounts at least to knowing (a.o.):</font></font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>some specific Linux syntax (for example,
directory separators are "/" rather than "\");</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>how the various Octave components are
put into a specific directory structure imposed by Unix/Linux standards
(FHS, see below);</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>where and how to put your personal Octave
scripts ("m-files") versus e.g., Octave distribution-supplied scripts;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>how to navigate through the Tex-info help
system.</font></font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>However, this HOWTO is not the place to
learn Linux. Check out the <a href="http://tldp.org/">Linux Documentation
Project</a> or get yourself a basic book on Linux usage;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Sooner or later, you will want to amend
things (or in particularly bad cases, you even might have to fix things)
"under the hood". Some knowledge of DOS and Linux will be very helpful.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Installation of Octave-for-Windows seems 
to be quite reliable these days, but mending even small troubles is nothing 
for computer-nitwits. If you think you are one, you had best try to install
Octave using the available "complete Windows binaries" on SourceForge, but 
if this fails, help from more knowledgeable colleagues / neighbours / friends 
is needed. And these colleagues / neighbours / friends in turn may benefit 
from the information in this document.</font></font></li>
</ul>

<u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Some background:</font></font></u>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>I got Octave running under Windows
using the (now unavailable) 2.0.13 Win32 binary and a gnuplot binary. I
had to scrape the Internet to get additional stuff like a subset of the
Cygwin utils, pipe-gnuplot, less (a Linux pager superior to the DOS-utility
"more"), termcap libraries, and lots of other stuff. After considerable
troubles, I got it all up and running. I had less troubles when I tried
to get Octave running under OS/2. Linux proved the easiest challenge in
this respect.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Later on, I installed the binary 2.1.31
Windows distribution by Tom Weichmann and found that contrary to his predictions,
both versions (2.0.13 and 2.1.31) co-existed and ran peacefully together
on one and the same PC (with different Cygwin systems installed in different
subdirectories on the same hard disk). Next I tried the octave-windows-oct25d.exe
binary from SourceForge but found that under my (Dutch) Windows-ME it did
not install properly.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>That was enough for a curious soul
to delve into it with more rigor. The results are below, but they are at
best incomplete.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Therefore, any suggestions, remarks,
criticism, hints and worked out solutions to all kinds of problems related
to Octave for Windows are welcome, of course as long as they are of reasonable
interest to the Octave-for-Windows community and not personal. Please e-mail
them to me and I'll try to incorporate them into this document. See the
end of this document for <a href="#response">contact info</a>.</font></font><br>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Please note that I am not a native
English speaker (or writer). Therefore, I also <b>do</b> appreciate linguistic
suggestions.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If you try one of the installation
methods below, it may help to know the following:</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>I have installed Octave for the second
time more or less along the lines outlined in method #3 (see below), using
the original Octave-for-Windows distro by Tom C. Weichmann (octave-windows.exe).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>More recent installations covered
Octave using cf. Method #1 on a (Dutch) Windows 2000; cf. Method 4a on
a (Dutch) Windows ME; and cf. Method 4b on a (US-English) Windows 98.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>My latest installation is Octave 2.1.42
+ Octave-Forge + Atlas optimizations on a Windows 2000 / Windows 98 dual
boot configuration.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Definitions"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>2. Some
definitions</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(This chapter is just meant to introduce
the unwary MS-Windows user to a few important Unix/Linux like concepts.)</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a></b>
(General Public Licence) is a licensing system which ensures that you,
the user, can always obtain, change and redistribute the source code of
any GPL-licensed program you want. This source code itself is free, however,
that does not necessarily hold for the media on which this source code
is delivered to you: you may not only think of costs of CD-ROM, but also
phone pulses and subscription rates to your ISP. To quote the FSF/GPL-website:
"Think of free speech, not free beer".</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a></b>
is an acronym of "GNU's not Unix", i.e. a mission to develop an operating
system based on the idea of free (in the sense of accessibility and freedom
to change and redistribute it) software.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a></b>
is a Linux-like environment which runs under MS-Windows. It is so good
that you can even run graphical user interfaces, e.g., like XFree86. 
Technically speaking, Cygwin is a Linux <u>emulator</u>,
it needs MS-Windows for several low-level system services. You had best perceive 
Cygwin as a virtual Linux system running under a MS-Windows host</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><a href="http://www.mingw.org/">Mingw</a></b>
is a project devoted to getting Linux programs to run <i>natively</i> under MS-Windows.
Linux source code is compiled directly and linked using some dedicated libraries 
and then can run directly under Windows. Cygwin is not needed.<br>
This seems an ideal way to get Octave (and for that matter, many other Linux/*nix
programs) running under Windows; but of course, it still remains an ideal. Linux/*nix 
and Windows simply differ too much to make this work perfectly. Nevertheless, Mingw has come
a long way and indeed several Linux/*nix programs can be made to run natively under
Windows. Octave, however, is too complicated (yet). Every now and then in the Octave
Maintainers mailing list some messages containing the word "mingw" pop up, but there still is much work
to do to be able to avoid Cygwin as far as Octave under Windows is concerned.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><a href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a></b>
is a mathematical toolbox / program / system developed under the GPL license.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The Octave version numbering scheme
complies to Linux conventions, where the second number refers to a stable
release if it is even, and a development release if it is odd. Thus, the
latest stable release (at the time that this document was updated, May
2003) is 2.<b>0</b>.17, the latest development release 2.<b>1</b>.48.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>(That said, Octave development releases
are not "dangerous" in the sense that they are able to lock up or crash
your Windows (like badly written programs can do, even on NT/2K/XP systems).
It is more that minor features, e.g. mathematical-linguistic interpretations
or documentation is still not up-to-date and some new and/or probably seldomly
used mathematical procedures may not have been tested fully.)</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><u><a href="http://matlinks.sourceforge.net/">Matlinks</a></u></b>
("Toolbox Development for GNU Octave and Matlab/Simulink") is -as its name
suggests- a collection of various toolboxes ("add-ins") for Octave and
Matlab.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><u>Distributions</u></b> (or "distros")
are usually "monolithic (i.e., one big file) packages from which you can
install Octave or some other program in one or another way. At first sight
this does not differ much from ZIP-files or self-installing archives for
MS-Windows programs you download from CNET or so. But read on, things are
a bit different.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Below, several types of distributions
are treated. I included this info just to show you programs are generally
installed in Unix/Linux and thus Cygwin systems, and to avoid confusion
further down in this web page.</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>"Tarballs"</b>are .tar, .tar.gz or
tar.bz2 archives, usually in one file, which are made by the archiving
program <i>tar</i>, optionally followed by compressing the so obtained
.tar archive using <i>gzip</i> or the more efficient <i>bzip2</i> compression
program.</font></font></li>
<br>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>"Source tarballs"</b> are usually tarballs
which contain just the source code, header files and general build instructions
and which should be unpacked at the place one normally keeps source files.
Although they contain just source code, they usually <i><u>are</u></i>
intended for installation of real programs!</font></font></li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>To compile a program from source and
put it in the right place, many Unix/Linux programs use the following commands
after unpacking:</font></font>
<br><b><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>./configure</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>This command finds out if all needed
libraries and compilers are there, if all system header files are present,
which versions they are and what options they accept, where several needed
utilities are located and which tricks they can perform. Based on this
info, one or more very detailed Makefiles are written which ensure that
the compiled program will run in an optimal fashion without problems on
<i><u>your</u></i>
system.</font></font>
<br><b><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>make</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>This will compile and link all source
files, resulting in one or more binary program files. The <i>make</i> program
invokes compilers, linkers etc based on the information in one or more
Makefiles.</font></font>
<br><b><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>make install</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>This will install the just-compiled
binary programs plus perhaps many other files into the right places on
your system.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>(I hope) you will realize that this
fully automated way of installing a program from source offers a lot of
flexibility. Well-written configure procedures may manage to get virtually
any program to run on virtually any system, no matter what version the
system components are and no matter how arcane your system setup might
be. (I do not want to do "Windows-bashing", but just compare this with
Windows programs which will run only on Win9x but not NT, or need NT with
at least Service Pack nr. X or so, with nothing to do about it.)</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>"Binary distributions"</b> are usually
tarballs which contain binary (= compiled) programs and setup information.
To install the programs in the right place, one usually needs to start
unpacking from a (given) default directory, often / (the root directory).
Another, safer procedure would be to unpack the tarball in a safe place
(e.g., somewhere in /home/ or /tmp) and -in a next step- put the programs
in the right place using a dedicated install command which was included
in the tarball and which checks that the program can be installed safely.
Binary distributions are usually dependent on several system components
having the right versions, and as such are less flexible than source distributions.</font></font></li>
<br>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>"Complete distributions"</b> is no
official term, but I introduce it here just for the sake of avoiding confusion.
While there are several binary Octave distributions which contain just
the Octave program plus perhaps some other back end programs, a while ago
T.C. Weichmann and J. de Marchi made some binary Octave distributions which
also contained the underlying Cygwin operating system emulation. For these
distributions I prefer the term "complete" distribution, as they do not
need to have Cygwin installed - indeed, if Cygwin was installed beforehand,
you run the risk that that existing Cygwin is ruined!</font></font></li>
<br>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>"RPMs"</b> are binary or source archives
in a special package format designed by RedHat, Inc., a big supplier of
Linux distributions - and for that matter, now the owner of Cygwin. RPM's
cannot (yet) be used on Cygwin distributions, only on native Linux systems.</font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>To summarize: in order to install
Octave (or any Linux program) you have the following options, in order
of <u>decreasing</u> flexibility:</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>1. source tarballs or source distributions</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>2. binary tarballs or binary distributions</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>3. complete distributions.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>As Cygwin is -in contrast to the plethora
of Linux &amp; Unix systems around- a quite well defined environment, binary
distributions bear little risk. Below some methods to install Octave are
indicated which use binary distros.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net">octave-forge</a></b>
is a collection of scripts and other stuff that make Octave more compatible
with that other program, <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(Be sure not to mix up octave-forge
with the "matcompat" stuff. If you ever encounter matcompat please ignore
it, it is obsolete and now succeeded by octave-forge.)</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">Windows</a></b>
is understood to be that family of operating systems developed by Microsoft
that is supposedly 32-bit - i.e., Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE
(Second Edition), Windows ME (Millenium Edition), Windows NT (any version),
Windows 2000 (several versions), Windows XP (the latter in two flavors,
Home and Professional), and -upcoming- Windows 2003 Server. But not Windows 3.1 or 3.11, 
not even with win32s installed.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>I wrote "supposedly", because not all
parts of these operating systems are fully 32 bit. For example, Windows
9x &amp; ME versions boot using 16-bit DOS operating systyem kernels, and
furthermore, parts of their GDI's (Graphical Device Interface) actually
still comprise 16 bit-routines. Windows NT, 2000 &amp; XP also still contain
some 16-bit function calls and API function arguments - although these
seem to be there for backward compatibility only, they are translated internally
to 32-bit versions.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Although all these Windows versions
seem to function quite similar to the average user, under the hood they
do differ considerably. A consequence is that many programs which run happily
on one version are not guaranteed to run without problems on another. Octave
shares this fate. Moreover, as Windows has been translated to many languages,
many install programs which rely on certain (English) directory names will
fail if they are started under non-English Windows versions.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Where I write "Windows" below, I mean
all versions of the OS. Where applicable I'll mention the Windows version
specifically.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b><a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">gnuplot</a></b>
is a stand-alone visualization program which - in contrast to what it's
name suggests- has nothing to do with GNU. Currently it is the most widely
used graphical back-end for Octave.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>BTW It seems that gnuplot is the preferred
name rather than GNUplot or Gnuplot.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;


<p><a NAME="Implementation"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>3.
Implementation of Octave under Windows</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Octave has been developed under Unix/Linux
platforms (originally SunOS and Ultrix) and given this heritage it depends
heavily upon a number of features specific to these platforms. Getting
Octave to run under Windows is therefore not an easy job. Octave is built
using a number of computer languages, i.e. C++, Fortran, plus a number
of other tools which take care of parsing command lines, navigation through
the built-in help and documentation systems, etc.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Therefore, Octave runs on Windows platforms
under a Linux emulator called <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>,
where all these utilities have been ported to. Similarly, for OS/2 systems
Octave is run using the EMX-library, which in fact also emulates a number
of Linux routines and interfaces. For yet other platforms other Linux emulators
(may) have to be used.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Apart from a more easy port to other
platforms, this has the indispensable advantage that the Octave source
code is completely independent from the platform it is to run on, making
maintenance of the sources a much more easy job.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A consequence of this is that Octave
is and remains a Linux-like program, again no matter what platform it runs
on. This implies that you, dear Windows user, better have some Linux knowledge,
because otherwise some Linux peculiarities will sooner or later bite you
in the leg.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In this respect a notable Linux heritage
is the (to the average Windows user) quite complex directory lay-out of
the usual Octave installation. E.g., script files are to be found seemingly
scattered around subdirectories in e.g., /usr/local/share/octave/2.0.16/m
(that is of course, for octave version 2.0.16); many of the intermediate
directories are just empty save for just one child directory.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In case you wonder, this is a consequence
of the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>,
a standard which suggests (rather than dictates) a very specific directory
structure for UNIX and Linux systems.</font></font>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Unlike Windows systems, where many
carelessly written installers simply dump your programs in the root directory
of C: and where the average program dumps all your texts/models/spreadsheets
in C:\My Documents, in Linux considerable attention is given to where specific
files and programs have to go. It can help a lot if you read the FHS documents
on the link above, or read an introductory Linux textbook.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Just like on Linux systems, Octave
for Windows is merely a "terminal program", i.e. it looks like it runs
in a DOS-box or DOS-terminal. Under Cygwin this terminal is actually a
Linux program called "bash" - a shell program (Bourne Again Shell), which
is in many ways similar (but superior) to the DOS-command interpreter COMMAND.COM.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;


<p><a NAME="Overview"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>4. Overview
of installation methods and other stuff</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>There are a number of ways to get Octave
installed under Windows:</font></font>
<ol>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Install Cygwin and compile Octave yourself</font></font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Build Octave yourself, after having
installed Cygwin. As most Octave users running Linux / AIX / etc. install
Octave by simply compiling the sources, this is not such a ridiculous suggestion
at all, although the average (in this respect somewhat spoiled, sorry)
Windows user may frown a bit here.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Although this methods implies some
more work, it does have some advantages:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>-You can install any Octave version
you like, stable, development or bleeding edge;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>-Maintenance of Octave and installation
of octave-forge is much easier (but the latter somewhat "involved"
due to Cygwin &lt;-> Windows limitations);</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>-You can easily adapt Octave to your
own wishes at your own discretion.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<li>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Using a "complete" Cygwin+Octave binary
distribution</font></font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Download the available (basic Cygwin+)Octave-windows
binaries from the SourceForge (advised) or Matlinks (IMHO deprecated) site.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>As far as the <i><u>Matlinks site</u></i>
is concerned, be warned that the complete 2.1.31 binaries from there do not always
install properly and that the way Cygwin and Octave are installed has some
side effects. Moreover, currently only (development-) versions 2.1.31 and
2.1.33 can be installed this way. The octave-forge stuff can only be partly
installed as this requires a more complete Cygwin installation.</font></font>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>As of August 2002, another complete Windows distribution
for Octave 2.1.36 including Octave-Forge was released which overcomes
a lot of problems encountered with the first complete distributions.</font></font>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The Windows binaries from the <i><u>SourceForge</u></i>
site are vey stable and much more complete.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Be warned that these complete distros
might wipe out, or at least render useless, an existing Cygwin installation. 
The latest complete Windows distributions at least warn you if an existing Cygwin
installation is going to be overwritten; we still wait for a complete distribution
which, in case it finds an existing Cygwin installation, leaves it alone and then 
just add Octave to it.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<li>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Expanding your system made in method
2</font></font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A mixture of both; that is, once a
basic Cygwin and Octave 2.1.31 or so are installed from a complete binary,
expand Cygwin by downloading and installing additional Cygwin components
(gcc, make, etc.) so that you can compile Octave yourself.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In a way, this looks like the best of 
both worlds, but to be able to use this method you first must have successfully
installed Octave using method 2…..</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<li>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Installing Cygwin yourself, then installing
Octave from (compiled) binaries</font></font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A fourth way is to download and install
Cygwin, and then download a binary Octave-distribution for Win32/Cygwin.
<p>This is a combination of methods 1 and 2, in the sense that you still have 
adequate freedom to choose which Octave version to install, but you do not
need to spend time to compile Octave yourself - that has already been done by
other people.
</font></font>
</ol>

<br><p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The "other stuff" department currently
comprises:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Installation of Matlab compatible scripts
from the octave-forge library.</font></font></li>
</ul>

<p><br><a NAME="Method1"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>5. Method
1: Building Octave yourself</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>&lt;<b>Note &amp; warning</b>: I haven't
tried compiling Octave myself for over year now (lack of time, &amp; the
complete distros are so good....). The instructions below, especially those
referring to cygwin setup itself, may not be fully up-to-date (although certainly
<b>not</b> in gross error). If you want to compile octave yourself, you should keep in mind that
some searching and experimenting may be needed with respect to cygwin itself></font></font></i>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>This consists of the following steps:</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Make sure you got about 400 to 500 Mb
free hard disk space. Octave + Cygwin need about 200 - 300 Mb, but your
Windows system might need some additional swap space (virtual memory),
too.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Download and install the necessary Cygwin
components (about a 40-60 Mb download altogether);</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Download the Octave source code (any version
you want; about 4-5 Mb)</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Configure, compile and install Octave
(all straightforward using the excellent scripts). Your free HD-space has
decreased by 80 Mb then;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Download gnuplot (either in binary form
(.Zip, about 750 Kb) or source code - .tar.gz, about 1.1 Mb) and install
it;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Connect gnuplot to Octave using a bit
of nitty-gritty work, plus some other details.</font></font></li>
</ol>
<a NAME="Step1"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Step 1. Prepare
your PC</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Make sure your PC is in good condition
with regard to:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Hard disk integrity (if needed, run SCANDISK.EXE)</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Hard disk free space. On my former desktop
PC, where I got Windows ME running a Cygwin system with gcc, make ....
etc. plus Octave 2.1.31 &amp; Octave 2.0.16, the entire Octave &amp; Cygwin
fandango occupied some 300 Mb disk space on a FAT32 partition and comprised
over 15,000 files, many of which were 1 or 2KB include files. Should you
have an old Windows 95 without FAT32 support, much more disk space may
be needed as FAT16 is not so efficient regarding disk space usage. So,
back up or clean up unneeded files.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Hard disk fragmentation (if needed, run
DEFRAG.EXE)</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In addition, in a later stage (when compiling
Octave) it can be handy to disable virus scanners, proxy's, firewalls,
and all kinds of other gadgets (notably MS-Office stuff like FastFind)
which occupy memory and system tray slots and only help to slow down the
system. Just press Ctrl-Alt-Del ONLY ONCE; on Win 9x &amp ME systems you can immediately 
see which programs have been loaded, on NT &amp 2000 &amp XP systems click the "Task Manager" button.
You can disable unneeded programs one by one in order to unload
them and free the CPU for more urgent tasks like running gcc. <br>
For a bare minimum Windows, in 9x &amp ME systems only Systray and Explorer are needed. <br>
For stripping down the number of "services" under Windows 2000 (and possibly NT and perhaps XP), 
many of which dominate system resources and/or just constitute resource hogs, have a look

<p><a NAME="Step2A"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Step 2A.
Download Cygwin</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Point your Internet browser to <a href="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</a>,
and start with reading a few things about Cygwin, notably what is mentioned
in the left column under "Documentation".</font></font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>** Please read at least the User's
Guide and FAQ **</font></font></b>,</center>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>only then download the program setup.exe
(click on the black-and-green "C" symbol).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Next, stay connected to your ISP </font><font size=-1>(if
you dialed in, do not close your dial-in connection. However, you do not
need your web browser from now on)</font><font size=+0> and doubleclick
on the just downloaded file setup.exe.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Choose "Download from Internet" and
at the next dialog box, choose a suitable download directory for all your
downloaded packages. It is best to keep the suggestion for Installation
directory to C:\cygwin.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>NOTE:</b> Be sure to install Cygwin
in a directory directly in the root of your C:-drive (e.g., C:\cygwin)
or in the root of any other hard disk partition. DO NOT USE SPACES in this
directory name, as a number of Cygwin utilities (notably mount) cannot
cope with names with embedded spaces!</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Current Cygwin setup-versions ask for
the kind of line-feeds right away (Unix-style vs. DOS-style). For the moment,
just specify "Unix-style".</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>DOS/Windows eol-s are usually CR/LF
(CarriageReturn &amp; LineFeed, while Unix/Linux eol-s are usually just
LF. I used to choose CR/LF (DOS/Windows style) and I have not encountered problems
yet. But certain problems with TexInfo may be related to this issue; the SourceForge
complete binaries install with Unix style line endings. Anybody
out there with a definitive answer?</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In this dialog you can also choose
for which users you will set up Cygwin. In fact, this is just a choice
between the Start Menu for "All users" or just for your own Start Menu.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(BTW When I did this on my Windows
2000 system, I did not need administrator privileges at all for the entire
Cygwin/Octave installation; power-user was good enough.)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>On the next dialog box, choose "Direct
connection" (that is, if you are still connected to the Internet using
your dial-up connection or LAN connection.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Then choose a suitable mirror for downloading
the packages.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>After a while, a list of packages appears.
Sections can be folded out by clicking on the +-sign. Be sure to select
(by repeated clicking on the leftmost symbol under the "New" column) the
following packages which are indicated in Table 1 below in the "Full" column
(and do NOT download the source code packages, deselect the relevant tick
boxes):</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>(I may have added one or two packages
too much here just to be safe, but that should not matter much.)</font></font>
<p><u><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Some comments:</font></font></u>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>binutils: contains the assembler and
linker/loader. Without it executables can't be made</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>bzip2: a very efficient archiving

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>ncurses: vital for various messages</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>perl: a very handy, much used scripting
tool</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>rxvt: a terminal program, needed for
better GUI under Win9x &amp; Win-ME</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>texinfo: needed for Octave's interactive
help system</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>People having much development experience
in Linux may want to install cvs, openssh and openssl too, as these allow
to download the most recent snapshot of octave sources from cvs (I never
tried, I just mention).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If your Internet connection consists
of a slow dial-up connection, you can (like I did) divide these downloads
over a number of cheap phone rate periods (weekends, nights) - or get a
high speed Internet connection like ADSL (like I did too, in a later stage
but for other reasons).</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Step2B"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Step 2B.
Actual installation of Cygwin</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Once you have downloaded all these
packages, disconnect from the Internet and again start up setup.exe.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>This time, select "Install from local
directory".</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Cygwin then installs all the packages
you downloaded, be sure to install them in the default suggested directory
(probably C:\Cygwin\). It installs a convincingly Unix/Linux-like directory
structure there, including /usr, /tmp, etc (where / stands for the root
of the Cygwin file system, i.e. C:\Cygwin in Windows parlance). The install
process ends with a number of alternating flashes of DOS-boxes (actually
Cygwin terminals) and Cygwin setup screens. Don't worry, just let it go
on.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>There is a file named Cygwin.bat installed
somewhere in the Cygwin directory. Make a copy of this batch file in e.g.
your \Windows directory. Make a Windows-shortcut for it, in your Start
menu and/or on your desktop, if the setup program did not already do that
for you.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Just check the Cygwin environment.
Doubleclick on the desktop icon. If all is well, you end up in a Cygwin
terminal, probably in your Cygwin home directory (/home/&lt; your_Windows_login_name>).
End the terminal with &lt;Ctrl>-D or by typing: exit</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In order to be able to cut-and-paste
into and from the Cygwin terminal, right-click on the desktop icon, select
"Properties" and in the "Misc" (Win 9x/ME) or "Options" tab (Win2000) uncheck
the Fast Pasting option. Additionally, check the "Quick Edit" option; I
found that pasting <i>from</i> a Cygwin terminal was much easier then.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Step3"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Step 3. Download
the source code for your favorite Octave version</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Point your Internet browser to <a href="ftp://ftp.octave.org/pub/octave/">ftp://ftp.octave.org/pub/octave/</a>,
select one of the source code packages from that site and download it into
a subdirectory of your Cygwin directory (e.g., /src/octave). (Windows Explorer
and thus all file dialog boxes derived from it can browse without any problem
through the Cygwin directory structure.)</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Step4"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Step 4. Configure,
compile and install Octave</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Start up Cygwin using the batch file
CYGWIN.BAT. You'll see a DOS-box like Linux terminal.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>=> From now on remember that, unlike
Windows, Linux DOES distinguish between upper and lower case letters in
file names etc.! So take care when you type a Linux command!</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>(A somewhat deceptive issue is that
not all parts of Cygwin seem to be case sensitive - better be prudent in
this respect.)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>=> Also remember that unlike Windows,
programs have to be in a directory in your (Linux-) PATH in order to be
able to start them. If you are sure you are in the same directory as where
your program file resides but you still cannot start it, the directory
is simply not in the PATH. You can start that program anyway then by prepending
"./" (without the quotes) to the program file name.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>O.K., Unpack the downloaded Octave
source-code distribution:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>cd /src/octave</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>tar -xvzf octave-&lt;version-number>.tar.gz</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>cd octave-&lt;version-number></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(where &lt;version-number> can be e.g.
2.0.17, 2.1.36, 2.1.48 etc.)</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>All the next steps are described in
detail in the files INSTALL and INSTALL.OCTAVE which are in the directory
octave-&lt;version number>. You can give it a try by going to the subdirectory
octave-&lt;version number> (cd octave-&lt;version number>) and typing (literally):</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>./configure</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>make</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>make install</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>(Mind the period before the slash in
./configure!)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The first command (./configure) took
about 15 (233 Mhz Pentium MMX with 64 MB memory) or 2 minutes (AMD AthlonXP
1600+ w. 512 MB) to prepare Octave for compilation. You can safely neglect
the last messages about gperf, runtest/dejagnu and/or gnuplot not being
found.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The second step (make) took two hours
(233 P-MMX) or 13 minutes (AMD 1600+), respectively.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The last step, Octave installation
proper, usually takes just a few minutes.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>After the last step you can find octave
in the directory /usr/local/bin, as an executable named octave-&lt;version
number> (e.g., octave-2.0.17).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(In addition, there is usually also

number>.)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If everything up till this step was
successfull, you now should already be able to run Octave.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Go (in the Cygwin terminal window)
to /usr/local/bin and type:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>./octave-&lt;version-number></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>After a while, you should see the welcome
message of Octave. You can try by typing:</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>help -i eig</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If all goes well, you'll see the TexInfo
message about usage of basic matrix functions. Quit by typing:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>q</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>followed by &lt;Ctrl>-D to quit Octave.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Finally, if after some time your Octave
runs satisfactorily, you can clean up by again going to the /src/octave/octave-&lt;version-number>
directory and typing:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>make clean</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>or more rigorously, simply deleting
the directory /src/octave</font></font>

<p><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>What if things go wrong?</font></font></u>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>I'm afraid I cannot help you much.
The output of ./configure gives clues as to what is actually wrong. But
it often happens that ./configure may report errors which are not the actual
errors themselves but are consequences of errors not detected earlier in
het configuration process. In the vast majority of cases, errors detected
by ./configure result from missing Cygwin packages.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Once ./configure has finished successfully,
it is unlikely that the next steps fail.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>For an (admittedly incomplete) overview
of a number of known problems, see below.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="STEP5"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Step 5. Download
gnuplot</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Point your web browser to <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">www.gnuplot.info</a>,
select a mirror site and and download the file gp371cyg.zip or gp371w32.zip
(or a later version indicated to be a Win32 binary for Cygwin).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>As this is a regular Windows ZIP-archive,
you can unpack it using <a href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</a> or another
archive program supporting ZIP format. After unpacking, follow the instructions
for installation of gnuplot.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Note 1: Installation of gnuplot in
the C:\Program&nbsp;Files directory (where most Windows programs are stored)
is no problem for Octave, nor for many other Linux programs run from the
Cygwin Linux emulator which might need gnuplot. As installation under 
C:\Program&nbsp;Files is a <i>de facto</i> convention for many a Windows package, just
put gnuplot there to avoid cluttering up your hard drive's root directory.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Note 2: Depending on the actual gnuplot
package, it will install also a subdirectory with a number of demo files.
These are quite worthwile, as gnuplot is also just by itself a very powerful
program. After Octave has made a plot by invoking gnuplot, you can use
the gnuplot command window to further enhance the picture.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If you insist on doing it the hard
way, you can also download the gnuplot source code and build gnuplot yourself.
I have not done this, so you are on your own if you want to try it.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Step6"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Step 6. Connect
gnuplot to Octave, and other nitty-gritty</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Some small things remain and need careful
attention:</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Connecting gnuplot to Octave (or vice
versa) using the program pipe-gnuplot;</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Revamping the terminal (something like
a DOS box) where Octave runs in;</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Making a shortcut to the Windows desktop
and/or Start menu;</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Enabling the function of the Del, Backspace,
Insert and arrow keys.</font></font></li>
</ol>

<u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>1A. Connecting gnuplot to Octave (or
vice versa) using the program pipe-gnuplot</font></font></u>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Some things to know in advance:</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Octave uses gnuplot for graphical output.
However, because Octave and gnuplot have no native way of communication,
Octave sends gnuplot some commands and information through a mechanism
called a "pipe". This mechanism comprises a one-way communication: Octave
can send info to gnuplot, but not the other way round;</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>When graphical output is requested by
the Octave user, Octave opens two windows:</font></font></li>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A graphical output window</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A gnuplot command window, where much of
the commands sent by Octave can be inspected and -if needed- edited and
then re-issued to gnuplot;</font></font></li>
</ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If needed, Octave-for-Windows starts up
gnuplot and initializes the connection, but it does so only once per session.
Therefore, you should not close down the gnuplot command window yourself
(but you can close the gnuplot graph window);</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Likewise, Octave closes down the gnuplot
windows if Octave itself is exited.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The way Octave communicates with gnuplot
imposes restrictions on graphical output. Several obviously needed options
are simply unavailable. Contouring is a notable problem. Mouse interaction
is not possible (but see below for a gnuplot 3.8 version which has preliminary
mouse support). Volunteers are needed to make all this possible, so if
you got some spare time, motivation and programming skills, please sign
up with the appropriate project leaders.</font></font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Currently there are two options to invoke gnuplot from Octave:
<ul>
<li>
pipe-gnuplot.exe
<li>
pgnuplot.exe
</ul></font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0><u>pipe-gnuplot.exe</u><br>
You need to get the program pipe-gnuplot.exe
(it must be put in a directory in the PATH, i.e. in /bin or /usr/local/bin).
You can do a web search for it; mid-2003 it could be found at:<br>
<a href="http://www.ecs.shimane-u.ac.jp/~kyoshida/pipe-gnuplot.exe">http://www.ecs.shimane-u.ac.jp/~kyoshida/octave_installeng.htm</a>
<br>(A version of) the source code is <a href="#Q_14">below</a>.)<br>
OK, in the file /usr/local/share/octave/site/m/startup
there should be a file called octaverc. This file contains some important
startup settings for Octave.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Take any text editor (Windows or Linux)
and make sure that the following lines get into octaverc (adapted from
Tom C. Weichmann's version):</font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>

##############################################################</font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>(Make any necessary changes if your
directory structure is different - take care of upper- and lower case characters.
If wgnuplot is not (yet) in your Cygwin path but somewhere else in the
Windows subdir hierarchy, enclose the path to wgnuplot.exe in quotes or
just add the necessary subdir to your PATH. E.g., here's my PATH:</font></font>

<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=-1>
$ echo $PATH<br>
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/cygdrive/c/Program&nbsp;Files/gnuplot/gp371cyg:/cygdrive/c/WINNT/SYSTEM32:/cygdrive/c/WINNT:/cygdrive/c/WINNT/SYSTEM32/WBEM:</font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=-1>N.B. As you can see I used the implicit
Cygwin mounts /cygdrive/c to refer to Windows drive/partition C:\</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>(Also note that the last line is commented
out. This line indicates that the gnuplot graph window must not be erased
before redrawing, but that next plots must simply be added to it. However,
you can also set this from the Octave terminal. I would prefer to have
it commented out.)</font></font>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0><u>pgnuplot.exe</u><br>
See below under "Other gnuplot options".</font></font>
</ol>

<u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>1B. Adapting the search path for gnuplot</font></font></u>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>In the directory /etc there should
be a file called profile. This file should contain at least the following
lines, or lines meaning the same as these lines:</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>export PATH=/bin:/usr/local/bin:/gnuplot3.7.1:$PATH</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>export HOME=/home/$USER</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=-1>(again, change paths and/or file names
if appropriate. If the path to gnuplot (here /gnuplot3.7.1, or in Windows
parlance c:\cygwin\gnuplot3.7.1) contains spaces, enclose it in quotes).
This file merely appends some directories to your implicit Cygwin-PATH
(which is different than your Windows/DOS search PATH). The important item
here is obviously the gnuplot subdirectory.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>That should do - if you now (re-) start
Octave, you should be able to use gnuplot. Try the following command from
an Octave window:</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>gplot rand (100,1) with linespoints</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>After a while the title bar of your
bash shell should show "pipe-gnuplot", and after some time a graphics window
containing a 2D-plot should appear.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Don't close the gnuplot window yourself,
Octave will do that as soon as you quit Octave.</font></font>
<p><a NAME="Step6A"></a><b><i><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Other gnuplot
options</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>PaulS&ouml;derlind suggested to download
<b>gp371w32.zip</b>
rather than <b>gp371cyg.zip</b>, because the former has pipe-gnuplot built
in and so avoids invoking pipe-gnuplot altogether. Instead of a separate
pipe-gnuplot.exe, this package now contains a pgnuplot.exe which -additionally-
may give a better pipe.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>In the octaverc file (in /usr/local/share/octave/site/m/startup)
the line</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>gnuplot_binary = 'pipe-gnuplot wgnuplot.exe';</font><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
can be replaced by:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>gnuplot_binary = pgnuplot.exe;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(assuming pgnuplot.exe and wgnuplot.exe
are in a directory in the PATH).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>However, in the help-octave mailing
list appeared some <a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2002/237">messages</a>
that under Windows 2000 and Windows XP, the pgnuplot driver was not working
properly, probably due to a bug in the gp371w32.zip package. So, on this
web page I still feature the "classical" way of linking gnuplot to Octave
using pipe-gnuplot.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A somewhat newer version of gnuplot
(3.8.i) -but still beta quality- including <a href="http://www.sci.muni.cz/~mikulik/gnuplot.html#PM3D">PM3D</a>
and mouse support, can be found on the Web. E.g., in May 2003, using
a <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> search, I found one <a href="http://www.sci.muni.cz/~mikulik/gnuplot/">here</a> (use the ...winbin.zip version).</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Step6B"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>gnuplot
alternatives</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>There are certainly alternatives in
case you don't like gnuplot or if you just want to try another visualization
program.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Currently, I know that at least <b>epsTk</b>
works OK with Octave within Cygwin.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>KMatPlot</b> (KDE is an X-windows
window manager for Linux, KMatPlot is a drawing program belonging to the
KDE suite), <b>PgPlot</b> and <b>Grace</b> may be viable alternatives too,
but I do not know if there is already an Octave interface for them which runs in Cygwin. 
I know that there is an interface for Grace, but that needed so-called .oct files 
(dynamically linked files) which is only recently possible under Cygwin. 
Have a look at <a href="http://www.octave.org/octave-lists/archive/octave-graphics.2002/msg00001.html">this message</a> 
for more info</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Although they appear to exist or have
existed, I could not find reasonable up-to-date Windows or Cygwin binaries
for <b><a href="http://plplot.sourceforge.net/">Plplot</a></b> (presently
at 5.1.0), which is a pity as there is a <a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/octave-sources/2001/55">link</a>
between Octave and plplot. I tried compiling it from its sources under
Cygwin, but to no succes.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>So, below is just a description for
epsTk.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Step6Bepstk"></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>epstk</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><a href="http://www.epstk.de/">epsTk</a>
is a visualization program which outputs Postscript files. IMO, epsTk also
features better contour plots than gnuplot.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Apart from the epsTk package you also
need Ghostscript (a free Postscript interpreter) and GSview (a Postscript
viewer).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Point your browser to <a href="http://www.epstk.de/">epsTk's
home</a>, read a bit about epsTk and then download the "<b>m &amp; doc</b>"
package (because then you'll also have some documentation).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Next, go to the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript
and Ghostview home site</a> (the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/">Ghostview
site on SourceForge</a> is geared more towards Linux although there are w32 binaries there) and download a Ghostscript
package and a GSview package, both for Windows. Now there is some issue
about the versions. Current GSview versions pop up a window asking for
a registration fee for the GSview programmer. There certainly is some justification
to ask money for such a wonderful piece of software, nevertheless you may
be distracted by these pop-ups or you may find 40 Australian $ simply too
much for your wallet; in that case you might like to know that earlier
GSview versions do not feature pop-ups. The downside is that these earlier
versions cannot be used with Ghostscript 8.0 (the latest version as of
May, 2003). So it's your pick: pop-ups OK or prepared to pay for shareware?
get the latest versions; not OK? find older GSview &amp; Ghostscript versions.
Don't worry, Octave / epsTK will work fine with such older versions.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>First install Ghostscript and GSview.
As they are Windows programs (errr... windows versions of programs), put
them somewhere in the C:\Program Files directory. After you've installed
Ghostscript and GSview, simply unzip (using WinZip or PowerArchiver etc.)
the contents of epsTk&lt;version_number>.zip to /usr/local/share/octave/site/m/
and make sure the contents are in the subdirectory epstk&lt;version_number>/m/
(e.g., /usr/local/share/octave/site/m/epstk191/m/). Then, move the contents
of the .../doc subdirectory to /usr/doc/epstk and remove the .../epstk&lt;version_number>/doc
subdirectory.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In the epstk m-file directory, you'll
find a file called einit.m. In the upper 10 lines or so, adapt the contents
of the variables %ePath, %eGhostview and %eGhostscript to your specific
setup.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>For example, my einit.m reads:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>ePath='./';%default directory of epstk-mfiles</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>%ePath='/usr/local/share/octave/site/m/epstk191/m/';%default
directory of epstk-mfiles</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>%eGhostview='ghostview -magstep -1';
%ghostview for linux</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>%eGhostview='gv -scale -2'; %ghostview
for linux</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>eGhostview='"c:/Program Files/Ghostview/gsview/gsview32.exe"';
%ghostview for windows</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>eGhostscript='gs'; %ghostscript for
linux</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>%eGhostscript='"C:/Program Files/Gs/gs7.04/bin/gswin32.exe"';
%ghostscript for windows</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>As you can see, I installed Ghostscript
in C:\Program Files\Gs and GSview in C:\Program Files\Ghostview. Installing
them in C:\Program Files is no problem, as the path names are enclosed
in quotes.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>You can now start up Octave and run
edemo1.m. If all went well, you will see a nice picture. To run the other
demos, you must "cd" (from within the octave terminal window) all the way
to the epsTk m-file directory (again, in my case, /usr/local/share/octave/site/m/epstk191/m/)
and run the demos from there. If all demos work OK, you can be confident
that your epsTk installation is OK.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Once epsTk is installed, you will have
to find out yourself how to use epsTk in practice (using the documentation
in /usr/doc/epstk). This web page is just devoted to get Octave working
under Windows :-)</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="rxvt"></a><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>2. Revamping
the bash terminal</font></font></u>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Instead of the classic white-letters-on-black-background,
you'll want black letters on a white background, and probably some neater
fonts. To do this, you'll need the rxvt program included in Cygwin.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Just make a file e.g. called start_octave-&lt;version-number>
in /bin or /usr/local/bin and make sure it reads something like:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>#!/bin/sh</font></font>

'^e' --keysym.0xFFFF '^f^h' -fn "Lucida Console-14" -tn linux -title Octave
-sr -sl 10000 -e octave-&lt;version-number></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(All stuff starting from "rxvt" on
one line!)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Next, make it executable (from a Cygwin
terminal): Go to the /bin or /usr/local/bin directory and type:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>chmod&nbsp;&nbsp; ugo+x&nbsp;&nbsp;
start_octave-&lt;version-number></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(The chmod command is a UNIX/Linux
command to set or change file attributes. Replace &lt;version-number> with
your desired octave version number, e.g. 2.0.17.)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Finally, make a DOS batch file called
OCT&lt;VersionNumber>.BAT (e.g., OCT2017.BAT), place it in /bin or /usr/local/bin,
make sure it reads:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>@echo off</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>chdir C:\Cygwin\bin</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>bash --login start_octave-&lt;version-number></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>(BTW By simple inspection of the file
start_octave-&lt;version-number>, it is easily seen how to change the font.)</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Method2"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>6. Method
2: Installation of available complete binaries (incl. Cygwin) from 
Matlinks / SourceForge</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>This is the easiest way of installing
Octave. Yet a number of problems are reported with these binaries.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>The biggest problem is that existing Cygwin installations are at risk if these complete
Windows binaries are installed.<br>
Upon installation of Cygwin, some registry keys are written. These constitute the 
so-called "mount table", where it is specified (amongst other stuff) at what point in the Windows file system
the root of the Cygwin file system is located. For example, is might say that "/" (the 
Cygwin root) might be at the Windows subdirectory C:\cygwin.</b>
Now a new Cygwin installation may lead to new registry keys which specify the root to be at
another place, say C:\GNU&nbsp;Octave. That implies that the new Cygwin cannot find the already
existing Cygwin components, and the existing components can't run because the information 
about where to find the root of their file system has been wiped out.<br>
Now you might say: "Hey, then I'll just specify the same directory for the new Cygwin as the 
old one". Cleverly thought up, but then you still run the risk that existing Cygwin
components/programs/libraries/configurations are overwritten by new versions which are 
incompatible with existing Cygwin programs.<br>
If you have an existing Cygwin installation, use <A HREF="#Method4">method 4</A> ("add Octave to 
Cygwin") rather than install a complete Windows binaries.</font></font>

<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">MATLINKS SITE</font></u></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Be aware that the binaries on the <a href="http://matlinks.sourceforge.net">Matlinks site</a>
are a bit outdated. I'd advise to use the complete Windows binaries from the SourceForge site (see below). 
Nevertheless, the makers of the Matlinks binaries (notably Tom C. Weichmann, and J. de Marchi) deserve lots of credit for
these first comprehensive and easily installable Windows binaries!</font></font>

<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">SOURCEFORGE SITE</font></u></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SourceForge site contains a number of complete Windows 
binaries which are based on the work of <a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2002/617">Agustin Barto</a> and which have further been developed
by Andy Adler. One of Barto's versions still resides on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5882">Matlinks download site</a> (it is called octave+forge.exe).<br>
Point your browser to octave.sf.net, click
on "Files" (upper right) and search in the Octave-Forge-Windows section for the file 
octave-2.1.42-windows-atlas.exe (about 10 MB).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Once you downloaded it, double-click on
the file. After a while some questions appear. The provided default answers
are often good enough, but for the type of CPU-optimization you must make
a proper choice yourself. If in doubt, select "noatlas". If you are sure
the CPU inside your PC is a Pentium II or a Pentium IV or an Athlon/AthlonXP
processor, select p2atlas, p4atlas or athlonatlas, resp. Even in case you
made the wrong selection, the only effect is that Octave might run very
much slower.<br>
<p>I found that there is no shortcut to the help-files in html format. You can make one 
yourself very easily by making a Start Menu or desktop shortcut to the file /html/octave_toc.html.<br>
A similar option concerns the epstk help files: make a shortcut to the file /html/epstk/index.html</font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Once you've successfully installed
one of the binaries using method 2, it is easy to add other Octave versions.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>All you need to do is:</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Expand your basic Cygwin package installed
from the octave-windows binaries to a development system, by downloading
setup.exe from the Cygwin site and next, downloading the needed packages
and installing them following the steps outlined under method 1, <a href="#Step2A">Step
2A</a> and further;</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Download the Octave source distribution
of your choice and compiling and building it, again see under method 1;</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Add an octaverc file (you can simply copy
it from the 2.1.31/m/startup directory);</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Revamping the Octave terminal using rxvt
(see under method 1 <a href="#rxvt">above</a>, too).</font></font></li>
</ol>
<br>


<a NAME="Method4"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>8. Method # 4,
Installation of cygwin, and then installing Octave from binary distribution</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>One can also just download and install
Cygwin without gcc-compilers etc. Just follow the instructions for Method
1 up to and including Step 2, but apart from the Cygwin base package just
download bzip2, texinfo, less, cygutils, rxvt and zip/unzip (i.e., the
packages in the column "Base" in <a href="#Table1">Table 1</a>).</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The next step would be downloading
a binary Octave distribution (much like native Linux distributions).<br>
You have a choice of several binary distributions (tarballs). Some of them feature ATLAS optimizations;
ATLAS implies much faster computations with large matrices, sometimes up to 10-15 faster than
non-optimized versions. However, ATLAS is heavily dependent on your CPU type.

<ol>
<li><A HREF="http://home.tiscalinet.ch/paulsoderlind/Software/Software.html#OctaveInstallation">Paul S&ouml;derlind's Octave web page</A> 
offers a 2.1.48 binary, currently (May 2003) without ATLAS optimization, but probably Paul will come up 
with optimized versions soon. <br>
Be sure to follow the brief but complete instructions on that web page. You must install gnuplot yourself.</li><br>

<li><A HREF="http://www.hhs.se/personal/psoderlind/Software/Software.htm#OctaveInstallation">Paul S&ouml;derlind's previous Octave 
web page</A> features just slightly older binaries (2.1.46), with and without ATLAS optimization. <br>
These binaries are also installed using the tar and gunzip programs.</li><br>

<li>On the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2888">Octave-Forge</A> site,
under the octave-2.1.42-cygwin header, you can find tarballs for again slightly older versions
(2.1.42) which include the Octave-Forge package, with ATLAS optimizations for several types of processors.<br>
if you are curious you can also try the still older 2.1.3x versions here.<br>
Download the package of your choice to some place in your Cygwin download directory, 
start up Cygwin setup, browse to the place you've downloaded the package and select to 
install it (you may have to expand the list of packages to see it). Click on Install, 
and Cygwin does (most of) the rest.
<br>The octave files (octave-2.1.35.exe etc.) and wgnuplot are put in the /bin directory rather than in /usr/local/bin
- this is because of some other (RedHat) Linux standards.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>In case you as a Windows user would
want to know: The reason is typical for Linux. The FHS (File system Hierarchy
Standard) dictates that in /bin belong only general system programs. Other
programs which should be safe from a system upgrade should go in /usr/local.
However, RedHat Linux and Cygwin both use (each a different) package management
for upgrades, so there's no need for /usr/local as far as binary packages
are concerned (software installed from tarballs are a different matter).
As in this case Octave is installed/upgraded/uninstalled by Cygwin package
management rather than from .tar.gz + compiling, according to this philosophy
it should go into /bin, too.</font></font><br>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>You can: 
<ul>
<li>
move the relevant files to /usr/local/bin
yourself (which will render automatic uninstalling &amp; upgrading difficult)</li>
<li>
leave them in place but make symbolic links to them from /usr/local/bin</li>
<li>
or just leave them in place and simply accept it (why not).</li>
</ul>
<p>Octave including gnuplot works "out of the box" in this distribution (that is, from the Cygwin terminal).</font></font>
</ol>

<p><a NAME="octaveforge"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>9. Installation
of the octave-forge package</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Matlab compatibility (to Matlab version
4.2) can be increased by installation of the <a href="http://octave.sf.net/">octave-forge
package</a>, assembled and maintained by the octave community.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>However, in order to install this octave-forge
package fully one must be able to make so-called .oct-files (dynamically
linked procedures) under Cygwin, an there is unfortunately still no easy solution for that
under Windows / Cygwin. You'd better use Andy Adlers complete octave-package from octave.sf.net 
as he has also installed Octave-Forge in it (statically linked rather than dynamically).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If you have installed Octave using
just method 2, you lack the gcc compiler, the make program and other utilities.
Then you can either add these and give it a try (see method 3, <a href="#Method3">above</a>)
or be satisfied with an incomplete installation of the octave-forge package.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In the latter case, you can use WinZip
or PowerArchiver to extract all the files under 'main" except for those
in the directory into the /usr/local/share/octave/&lt;<i>version-number</i>>/m
directory (be sure to check the "Use folder names" check box to keep the
directory structure in the archive). In the "FIXES" directory in the octave-forge
archive, various enhancements to standard Octave functions are supplied,
but these are not sorted into the various directories under /usr/local/share/octave/&lt;<i>version-number</i>>/m.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In case you insist, <a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2002/194">here</a>
is a message from Andy Adler where he describes how he got it together.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Problems&Fixes"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>10.
Some known problems and fixes</font></font></b>

<p><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>1. Octave installed from a complete
binary, but it doesn't work</font></font></u>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Usually this is due to a non-English
Windows version or too little default environment space for DOS programs.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In the typical case there is usually
a file OCTAVE.BAT which contains nonsense, and/or the Octave directory
contains only 2 or 4 Mb of stuff, and/or doubleclicking on the Octave desktop
item or in the Start Menu (if these "shortcuts" exist at all) leads to
an error message like "no such file or directory".</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Sorry to tell you that you are one
of those unlucky souls with a computer where the Win-Octave binary simply
doesn't install (or better: doesn't install in a simple way).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If you are no programmer, do not know
much about Windows and/or Linux, there's little to be done about it, sorry.
Only way out is to search the help-octave mailinglist for answers (I'm
also collecting them on this page, but I lack time to finish it).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>You might try one of the other Win-Octave
distro's. Whereas octave-windows-2000oct25d.exe (from the <a href="http://download.sourceforge.net/matlinks/">Matlinks
site</a>) did not install properly under my (Dutch) Win-ME, the original
distro (octave-windows.exe; also from Matlinks) did. Probably it is a wise
thing to delete the complete Cygwin &amp; Octave directories first from
your Windows partitions.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If you do insist on getting Octave
under Windows rather than Linux, I would still advise you to use Method 2 and 
take the SourceForge complete Windows binaries, or if you got the time for it, 
Method 4 (above): install a basic Cygwin and then use one of the Octave binaries. 
Currently those are the most reliable and most complete ways to get Octave installed 
under Windows.</font></font>

<P><U><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>3. Mysteriously vanished Cygwin</U></P>
<P>Currently available complete windows binaries, which usually include a new Cygwin, simply overwrite the Windows registry keys which pertain to existing Cygwin installations. As a result, pre-existing Cygwin installations are disabled. If the Octave distro installation directory happens to be the same as the one where the original Cygwin installation lived, it can even be ruined for ever.</P>
<P>The cause is obviously that you installed a complete binary cf. Method 2 rather than a cygwin binary cf. Method 4.<br>
It may be possible to repair your original Cygwin registry keys, but that comprises hacking around in the Windows registry. You then run risks like mistyping, sudden power drops and others, and as any registry editing is effected <I>immediately</I>, you run a very real risk of even ruining your complete Windows.<br>
You'd better try to restore things by just re-installing the Cygwin base package - that will probably restore the registry keys; be sure to specify the proper Cygwin install directory in the Cygwin setup!<br>
Luckily the newest complete windows binary distro checks for existing Cygwin installations.</font></font></P>


<p><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>3. Languages</font></font></u>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Beware that translated Windows versions
(i.e., non-English Windows versions) may have other names for certain standard
directories than the English version. However, many setup programs blindly
assume English standard directory names.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Possible candidates are "\Program
Files", "My Documents", etc.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Ofcourse, <i>these</i> problems can
simply be tackled by just creating the relevant directories with the proper
English names on your C:\-drive :-). Octave will be installed there without
problems. IMHO no complex patches to the install binaries are needed.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>AFAIK Cygwin does not rely on these
names, but the available Octave-for-Windows binaries on SourceForge / Matlinks
seem to do. Nevertheless, in <a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2001/1145">this</a>
help-octave mailing list message some more info on this language problem
is given.</font></font>

<p><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>4. Environment space</font></font></u>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Many programs which are started from
a DOS window, including Cygwin bash, need some storage space for so-called
environment variables. Those are variables which have a "string value";
e.g. your PATH environment variable, which tells DOS programs where to

search for a program, usually has the value "C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND;"
or something like it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A number of DOS programs need extra
environment space, because they need to store an awful lot of environment
variables and/or their environment variables have very long string values.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Therefore, the DOS-box they are run
in should be started with the following setting in the Memory tab of the
Properties dialog box (right-click on the DOS-box icon):</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Initial environment = "Automatic" or
(preferrably) 4096</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If you encounter problems running Cygwin
or Octave, changing this setting may help.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q1"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 1: How can I

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 1: </b>See <a href="#Overview">above.</a></font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q2"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 2: Why don't
several of my Matlab m-files run in Octave?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 2: </b>Because Octave is not
completely compatible with Matlab. A number of simple things to know:</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Comments in Octave begin with # rather
than % (that said, Octave accepts a %-sign as well as a #)</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Octave is compatible with Matlab (maybe)
version 4.2. FYI, the current (May 2003) Matlab version is 6.5.</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Compatibility is better after installation
of the <a href="http://octave.sf.net">octave-forge</a> package (see <a href="#octaveforge">above</a>
for more info on how to get it installed)</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Invoking Octave with the argument --traditional
makes it behave somewhat more like Matlab - but then again, a.o. the less
pager will be non-functional, too.</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Look in the general Octave FAQ <a href="http://www.octave.org/FAQ.html#SEC24">here</a> and at the
<a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/compatibility.html">Octave Compatibility FAQ</a> at what the Octave maintainers say about Matlab compatibility and porting
Matlab scripts.</font></font></li>

<p><a NAME="Q3"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 3: Why does Octave-for-Windows
use so much Linux conventions?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 3: </b>Because it is essentially
a set of Linux programs disguised as one big Windows program. Read the
start of this web page for more....</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q4"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 4: Are the (complete)
Windows binaries from Matlinks really as bad as the mailing list messages suggest?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 4: </b>Well, first of all, they
are NOT such bad binaries, in fact, they <b><i>are</i></b> quite <b><i>good</i></b>.
FYI, I used one myself.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Also remember that people who succeed
with installing Octave under Windows probably won't report it in the help-octave
mailinglist! so the mailing list messages offer at least a biased view
of the rates of success or failure.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>That said, there are a number of typical
problems:</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Language problems. As Windows has been
translated into a multitude of languages, and as the binary distribution
installer seems to rely on US-English directory names, chances are that
you'll run into trouble when you try to install using a complete binary
distribution on a non-English Windows version. Although there is a <a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2001/1145">possible
solution</a>, your best option in such cases is to install Cygwin and Octave
yourself along the lines of <a href="#Method4">method #4</a> (above).</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Little bugs (buglets), for example, the
info command (a sort of help system) does not work properly because a wrong
Texinfo version has been used to build the binary distribution.</font></font></li>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If you can live with the buglets,
well, go use the complete binaries.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If you can't, or cannot get Octave
installed, I'd suggest to use <a href="#Method4">method #4</a>. Admittedly
a bit more work, but it is the most reliable and flexible method there
is.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q5"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 5: Is there no
GUI?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 5: </b>Have a look <a href="http://merlin.inescn.pt/~qual/tk_octave/tk_octave.html">here</a>
for Tcl/Tk front end building blocks. Tcl/Tk is a script language usable
for building GUIs. I doubt if it will ever get as slick as the Matlab GUI
or Windows or Apple GUIs but it looks very usable to me. Admittedly you
will have to learn at least some basic Tcl/Tk, but that is very simple
indeed.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In addition, at the <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/">Octave-Forge
site</a> you have a link to the <a href="http://sophie.kstraight.net/goctave/">Octave-GUI
build project</a>. Admittedly it is for <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>
(a Linux X-Windows graphical environment), but who knows what spin-off
will come from it. Besides, you CAN run X-Windows and thus probably GNOME
from Cygwin.....</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q6"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 6: How fast is
Octave, e.g. compared to Matlab?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 6: </b>From my experience I can
tell that under Windows, Octave runs about 30 % faster than my Matlab 5.1
student edition. But... nowadays Matlab has a faster numerical LAPACK engine
(more or less the same that Octave was using for a long time), so this
advantage may now have evaporated.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Comparing Linux vs. Windows installations
on the same PC (I got both, and also OS/2 Warp 3 with Octave 2.1.23, installed
on the same computer), the Linux Octave version is about 2 to 3 times faster
than the Window version; the OS/2 version also runs twice as fast as the
Windows one. Typically a case for Linux I'd say.... ;-)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Under Windows, a very notable delay
occurs when gnuplot is invoked. Because of the pipe mechanism, which is
not a native Windows interprocess communication design (it is more a Cygwin
revival of an old DOS heritage), it may take several seconds before your
graph emerges on the screen. Using other operating systems than Windows,
gnuplot graphs appear MUCH quicker.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Octave builds based upon ATLAS are
again much faster especially when computations on large matrices come into
play.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q7"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 7: Why do I get
a message "...broken pipe" when I attempt to make another graph?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 7: </b>You probably manually
closed not only the gnuplot <i>graph</i> window but also gnuplot's <i>main</i>
window. Octave-for-Windows launches ("spawns") gnuplot automatically during
its starting up sequence and does so only once. To be able to make a second
graph, simply stay away from gnuplot's command window once you have (re-)started
Octave.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q8"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 8: Why do contour
plots fail? The same script ran perfectly in Matlab....</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 8: </b>The order of parameters
for the contour() call in the original Octave script files are different
than those of Matlab. This is fixed in the octave-forge package, as well
as more recent versions of Octave.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>However, I have the impression that
gnuplot expects seperate full 2-D matrices with X and Y coordinates in
addition to the Z-values, while Matlab uses 1-D X and Y coordinate vectors
(or the situation is <i>vice versa</i>, I'm not sure).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A volunteer will have to sort this
out.... you?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>By the way, you can also try epsTk's
contouring options (<a href="#Step6Bepstk">see above</a>).</font></font>
<p><a NAME="Q9"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 9: How can I
cut-and-paste to / from the Octave-window?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 9: </b>From Octave to any other
Windows program works with Ctrl-X/Ctlr-C (cut/copy), paste with Ctrl-V.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>From Windows to Octave: Use Ctrl-Ins
rather than Ctrl-V.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q10"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 10: How about
reliability or verification of the Octave code?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 10: </b>There you have some difficult
aspects, which actually do not belong in this FAQ as they refer to Octave
in general. But -understanding the motives for this question, I've worked
in ISO 9001 certified organizations myself- I'll just say this:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>As regards <u>reliability</u>, from the
perspective of harm or negative influences to existing software environments:</font></font></li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Octave itself is just a program running
under (interpreted by) Cygwin. That restricts any risks associated with
running Octave to its influence on Cygwin.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In turn, Cygwin is the program (-suite)
which actually gets installed in a Windows environment and thus may "influence"
that environment. Again, this FAQ is not the place to answer that question,
you'd better contact <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">RedHat</a>
(the owner of Cygwin) on this issue - AFAIK they *do* feature (paid) support
for Cygwin.</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0><u>Verification:</u> Many many Octave
features, procedures and computations have been thorougly tested in practical
situations by the Octave community, and in that respect Octave is probably
very reliable. But regarding Total Quality Management and/or ISO 9001 procedures,
there is AFAIK no formally documented verification. If you do need this
to incorporate Octave in your company's TQM software listings or defend
Octave to TQM or ISO 9001 assessors or auditors, you probably must set
up some test cases yourself. BTW The same goes for gnuplot etc.</font></font></li>
</ul>

<a NAME="Q11"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 11: How can I make
.oct-files (dynamically linked libraries)?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 11: </b>That's not an easy job. It 
*is* possible to have dynamically linked libraries associated with Octave in a 
Windows environment, but it is still not for the weak of hearts. From what I understand,
the problem lies with some incompatibilities between Cygwin libraries and
Windows style .dll libraries. Still curious? OK, some info is <a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2002/75">here</a>
and something you can use as a suggestion is <a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2002/671">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2002/1107">here</a>.<br>
Once you got it running, the 
<A HREF="http://octave.sourceforge.net/coda/coda.html">"Da Coda Al Fine"</A> pages 
can help you to get started with .oct files.<br>
You can statically link procedures, however.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q12"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 12: How can
I uninstall Octave &amp; Cygwin?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 12: </b>Described here is a way
to completely remove all traces of any Cygwin or Octave installation (copied
from the <a href="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#SEC19">Cygwin FAQ</a>):</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>1. Delete the entire Cygwin directory.
You can do that simply from Windows Explorer. Click once on the base directory
(e.g., c:\cygwin) and then press SHIFT-DEL (= delete w/o putting it in
the Recycle bin).</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>2. In the Registry Editor (Start -> Run
-> regedit.exe), remove the Cygwin keys in:</font></font></li>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software (just
click once on Cygwin, then press DEL).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Check in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software
for similar keys and -if found- remove them.</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>3. Remove the Cygwin shortcuts from your
desktop and the Start Menu.</font></font></li>
</ul>

<a NAME="Q13"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 13: How can I acces
files on any of my hard disk partitions from Cygwin &amp; Octave?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0><b>A 13:</b> From a Cygwin prompt,
simply type:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mount</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>and then you'll see something which
looks like:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>$ mount</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>C:\cygwin\bin on /usr/bin type system
(textmode)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>C:\cygwin\lib on /usr/lib type system
(textmode)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>C:\cygwin on / type system (textmode)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>c: on /cygdrive/c type user (textmode,noumount)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>d: on /cygdrive/d type user (textmode,noumount)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>e: on /cygdrive/e type user (textmode,noumount)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>o: on /cygdrive/o type user (textmode,noumount)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>$</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>from which you can learn the following:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The Cygwin root directory / corresponds
with Windows C:\Cygwin</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>/usr/bin is somehow linked to /bin</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The same goes for /usr/lib</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>My local drives C:, D: and E: (all FAT32
partitions) are mounted on /cygdrive/c, /cygdrive/d and /cygdrive/e, respectively</font></font></li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>My network drive (in Windows parlance)
\\AthlonXP\C, which is connected automatically to Windows drive letter
O: by Windows Explorer as soon as I boot Windows ("Reconnect at logon"),
is also automatically mounted by Cygwin to /cygdrive/o. This means that
even network drive mappings are mounted automatically by Cygwin as long
as Windows has assigned a drive letter to it.</font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Indeed, after you have started up
Cygwin, you can map additional network drives to Windows drive letters
using Windows Explorer (Tools, Map Network drive...) and when you return
to your Cygwin terminal, you will see that the newly mapped network drives
have been mounted automagically, too......</font></font></ul>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Knowing this, it cannot be difficult to
navigate through your entire Windows network using Cygwin.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q_14"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Q 14: Where can

<p><a NAME="Q_15"></a><b><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Q 15: How about
network installations for Octave?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><b>A 15:</b> In principle, for network
gurus this should be easy. But then again, in the Windows world you got
MS-Windows/NT networks, Netware, Banyan Vines, etc etc etc. To explain
how to set this up for even just the widely used network software brands
would constitute a HOWTO in its own right.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>In addition, network setup in general
comprises a universe in its own right and specific network setup problems
may well interfere with specific Octave-Windows setup problems, and more
specific, with Cygwin setup problems.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Therefore, as long as nobody comes
up with short description for an easy solution, IMO this subject is not
amenable for inclusion here, sorry.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="Q_A"></a><b><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Q 16?: How can
I upgrade my Octave under Windows to a newer version?</font></font></b>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><b>A 16:</b> It depends. If you have
used one of the latest complete Windows binaries from SourceForge, chances
are that the Cygwin installation is fairly basic and lacks essential tools
for making Octave upgrades easy. Other complete binaries may or may not
include these tools, I do not know as I did not test them all, and when
I tested some of them I did not care at the time.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Currently I use the latest 2.1.42-noatlas
binary from SourceForge which does not include the relevant tools.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Using this version as an example,
I'll show you the relevant steps. You can see for yourself which steps
to take and which to skip.</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>You will have to use some Cygwin tools
to upgrade Octave, which means using Cygwin's command line interface (which
looks a bit like good old DOS). First of all, the packages tar, bzip2/bunzip2
and/or gzup/gunzip plus relevant libraries are needed.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>We'll start with showing how to start
up a bash shell (i.e., the DOS-like command line interface), then we'll
check if you got the needed packages, and if not, how to install them.
Ensuing steps comprise downloading and installing newer binary Octave distributions
(not complete distros, see chapter 2 (Terminology) if you forgot the differences).</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><u>Step 1: Starting up a bash shell, if
present</u></font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Browse you Start Menu of desktop for
a shortcut to Cygwin, or Cygwin Bash Shell, or something like that. If
present, fire it up.</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>If you can't find it, chances are that
it is present but not linked into the Start Menu.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Find out in which directory on you
hard disk Cygwin has been installed. The easiest trick is to use Windows
Find Files tool: Start Menu, Search, Find Files or Folders, and then search
for the file "bash.exe" (do not enter the quotes).</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>If bash is present, it will be in
the /bin directory of your Cygwin installation, or in Windows terms, in
the subdirectory .\bin of the directory Cygwin (or GNU Octave, or whatever
directory Cygwin has been installed in). If you found bash.exe, check if
you have a file called CYGWIN.BAT in the / directory (the Cygwin directory).
If there isn't and you have no bash.exe, you will have to download bash.</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>If bash is not present, just search
for the file "rxvt.exe" rather than bash.exe. That will also show you where
the .\bin (/bin) directory is located. Just write down the name of the
Cygwin directory (in my case it is C:\Programs\GNU Octave, but it may be
something like C:\Cygwin or so).</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><u>Step 2: Checking for the presence of
tar, gzip and bzip2 &amp; libs</u></font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>In the /bin directory, try to locate
the files tar.exe, bzip2.exe, bunzip2.exe, gzip.exe and gunzip.exe. If
they are present, you're OK. If not, you'll have to download them.</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><u>Step 3: Downloading and installing
tar, gzip, zlib, and bzip2, libbz2*</u></font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>This proceeds largely along the steps
outlined in Step 2A above, about compiling Octave yourself. Point your
browser to http://cygwin.com and click on the "Install or update now!"
button (below the black "C" with green arrow inside). This will initiate
downloading of Setup.exe, the Cygwin installer; make sure you download
it to some temporary directory.</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Next, close down your browser (but
retain your Internet connection) and doubleclick on the just downloaded
Setup.exe file.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>It may ask you to temporarily disable
your virus scanner (answer Yes) and then to choose from "Install from Internet",
"Download from Internet", or "Install from local directory". Choose the
second option ("Download ...", especially in case you got a slow dial up
Internet connection and select a local package directory (usually the default
suggestion should be OK). If you have a fast flat-rate Internet connection,
you can as well select "Install from Internet" and skip the steps relating
to local download directories further down here.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>On the next question select "Use IE
settings", usually that should do if Internet Explorer is your default
Internet browser. Next, select a suitable download mirror site from the
list, and wait until the complete package list has been downloaded.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Now, if needed expand all branches
(click on the "+" syb\mbols), and check all items in the "New" column.
Make sure that they are all set to either "Keep" or "Skip"; if needed click
on the version number until the word "Skip" is shown.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>It is a long list; nevertehless make
sure that ALL packages are set to "Keep" or "Skip", EXCEPT for the ones
you found were lacking in steps 1 and 2 above: bash, tar, gzip, bzip2 and/or
the related libraries zlib and libzip2. In addition, select PostinstallLast
/ update_info_dir.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>When you have selected them, once
more browse top-wown through the list to be sure that just these packages
are selected and not additional ones like ash, libintlxxxx, libiconxxxx
etc. The, click on "Next" and the selected packages will be downloaded
(or installed). In the end, Cygwin setup will show a pop-up box telling
that is has finished and then it terminates.</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Then, browse through the directory
ftp%.......\release which was made and where the downloaded packages reside,
and simply delete all subdirectories containing packages you don't need
but which were downloaded anyway.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Then again doubleclick on Setup.exe
and select "Install from local directory". Let your virus scanner be temporarily
disabled, browse to or enter the name of your Cygwin directory (see Step
1), select "All Users" and "Unix" and press "Next" a few times. You can
ignore the warning about spaces in directory names. In the package window,
(try to) expand all sections and check that only the packages selected
by you will be installed. Then click "Next". After installation, you can
select to have icons / shortcuts added to your desktop and/or Start Menu;
I would at least select the latter.</font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0></font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Now, try to run bash: In the Start
Menu, select Cygwin Bash shell. You should now see a DOS-like command
line window. Typing the ëxit"command or pressing Ctrl-D ends it.</font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><u>Step 4: Downloading a more recent Octave
binary Cygwin distribution</u></font></font><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><br>
Choose a suitable binary distro, look under <a href="#Method4">Method 4</a>.</font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><u>Step 5: Installation of the newer Octave
binary&nbsp; Cygwin distribution</u></font></font><br>

<font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>Fire up Cygwin setup, select "Install from local directory"
and browse to the directory where you downloaded the new octave tarball. Next select it for installing 
and press the Next button a number of times. This should do! </font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0><u>Step 6: Adding shortcuts and rounding up</u></font></font><br>
<font face="ARIAL"><font size=+0>It is wise to leave your "old" Octave intact until you 
are sure the new version is equally good or better than the old one (remember, we almost
all use development versions). Two or more Octave versions can very happily live together;
they all use the same .m file hierarchy, including .octaverc in ./site/m/startup and the
gnuplot stuff.<br>
How to test Octave from a cygwin terminal and how to make shortcuts in your Start Menu and/or
desktop is described under Step 2 of Method 1 ("Revamping the bash terminal") and further.<br>
Only problem I foresee is that the new Octave version may grab the Cygwin shortcut: the latter, 
octave or octave-sh, is usually linked to a file octave-&lt;version&gt;. The Windows link often refers to the 
Cygwin link rather than the octave-&lt;version&gt; file itself.</font></font>
