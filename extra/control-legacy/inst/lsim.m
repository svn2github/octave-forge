## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{y}, @var{x}] =} lsim (@var{sys}, @var{u}, @var{t}, @var{x0})
## Produce output for a linear simulation of a system; produces 
## a plot for the output of the system, @var{sys}.
##
## @var{u} is an array that contains the system's inputs.  Each row in @var{u}
## corresponds to a different time step.  Each column in @var{u} corresponds to a
## different input.  @var{t} is an array that contains the time index of the
## system; @var{t} should be regularly spaced.  If initial conditions are required
## on the system, the @var{x0} vector should be added to the argument list.
##
## When the lsim function is invoked a plot is not displayed; 
## however, the data is returned in @var{y} (system output)
## and @var{x} (system states).
