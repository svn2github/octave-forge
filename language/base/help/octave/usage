@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} usage (@var{msg})
Print the message @var{msg}, prefixed by the string @samp{usage: }, and
set Octave's internal error state such that control will return to the
top level without evaluating any more commands.  This is useful for
aborting from functions.

After @code{usage} is evaluated, Octave will print a traceback of all
the function calls leading to the usage message.

You should use this function for reporting problems errors that result
from an improper call to a function, such as calling a function with an
incorrect number of arguments, or with arguments of the wrong type.  For
example, most functions distributed with Octave begin with code like
this

@example
@group
if (nargin != 2)
  usage ("foo (a, b)");
endif
@end group
@end example

@noindent
to check for the proper number of arguments.
@end deftypefn
