@deftypefn {Function File} {} poly (@var{a})
If @var{a} is a square @math{N}-by-@math{N} matrix, @code{poly (@var{a})}
is the row vector of the coefficients of @code{det (z * eye (N) - a)},
the characteristic polynomial of @var{a}.  If @var{x} is a vector,
@code{poly (@var{x})} is a vector of coefficients of the polynomial
whose roots are the elements of @var{x}.
