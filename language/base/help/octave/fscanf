@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {[@var{val}, @var{count}] =} fscanf (@var{fid}, @var{template}, @var{size})
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {[@var{v1}, @var{v2}, @dots{}, @var{count}] = } fscanf (@var{fid}, @var{template}, "C")
In the first form, read from @var{fid} according to @var{template},
returning the result in the matrix @var{val}.

The optional argument @var{size} specifies the amount of data to read
and may be one of

@table @code
@item Inf
Read as much as possible, returning a column vector.

@item @var{nr}
Read up to @var{nr} elements, returning a column vector.

@item [@var{nr}, Inf]
Read as much as possible, returning a matrix with @var{nr} rows.  If the
number of elements read is not an exact multiple of @var{nr}, the last
column is padded with zeros.

@item [@var{nr}, @var{nc}]
Read up to @code{@var{nr} * @var{nc}} elements, returning a matrix with
@var{nr} rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple
of @var{nr}, the last column is padded with zeros.
@end table

@noindent
If @var{size} is omitted, a value of @code{Inf} is assumed.

A string is returned if @var{template} specifies only character
conversions.

The number of items successfully read is returned in @var{count}.

In the second form, read from @var{fid} according to @var{template},
with each conversion specifier in @var{template} corresponding to a
single scalar return value.  This form is more `C-like', and also
compatible with previous versions of Octave.  The number of successful
conversions is returned in @var{count}

complete description of the syntax of the template string.
