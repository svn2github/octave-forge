Summary of important user-visible changes for miscellaneous 1.1.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** IMPORTANT NOTE:
    * the function `waitbar' has been renamed `text_waitbar'. Octave core has
      implemented a Matlab compatible `waitbar' which is imcompatible with the
      old miscellaneous `waitbar'. If you use the `waitbar' function from the
      miscellaneous package you have 3 options:
        1. replace all `waitbar' calls by `text_waitbar';
        2. fix your `waitbar' calls for the new API as per octave core. Note
           that `waitbar' is graphical tool only;
        3. use an old version of the miscellaneous package or modify the source
           to keep shadowing the octave core `waitbar'

 ** The following functions are new:

      clip
      text_waitbar

 ** The function clip was imported from the audio package

 ** The following functions have been deprecated (see their help text
    for the recommended alternatives):
