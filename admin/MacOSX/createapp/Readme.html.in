<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>GNU Octave is a high&ndash;level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch&ndash;oriented language. For further information visit <a href="http://www.octave.org">http://www.octave.org</a>. <br> <br>
Octave.app is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;run binary version of GNU Octave. It runs on most of Apple's Mac OS X computers and comes with all the GNU libraries that are needed to run Octave.app. The application can also be expanded by downloading and installing further packages from the Octave&ndash;Forge's website at <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net">http://octave.sourceforge.net</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Requirements</h2>

<p>If your Apple computer comes with Motorola's PowerPC processor then you need to have installed at least Mac OS X version 10.3. Download the file <span class="file">octave-%VERSION%-ppc.dmg</span> that includes the ready&ndash;to-run binary version of GNU Octave for PPC Macs. If you have a newer Apple computer that comes with an Intel processor then you need to have installed at least Mac OS X version 10.4. Download the file <span class="file">octave-%VERSION%-ia32.dmg</span> that includes the ready&ndash;to&ndash;run binary version of GNU Octave for Intel Macs. <br> <br>
If you want to use graphical outputs from Octave that can be made with the commands <span class="command">plot</span>, <span class="command">mesh</span>, <span class="command">surf</span> etc. then you need to install the Gnuplot application. For further informtations visit the website <a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net">http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net</a>.
 <br> <br>
If you want to further install Octave packages from the Octave&ndash;Forge's website <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net">http://octave.sourceforge.net</a> then you must install the Apple's XCode Tools from 'DVD 1 of your Mac OS X Install Discs' before. To make sure that you have installed the latest version available visit Apple's XCode Tools website <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode">http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Installation</h2>

<p>Installing Octave.app is easy. Just drag the Octave.app icon from the <span class="file">octave.dmg</span> to another place of your filesystem (eg. to your desktop or even better to your applications folder) and that's it, you're done. Double&ndash;click the Octave.app to start up Octave. <br> <br>
This does not installed any further files elsewhere in your filesystem. To remove it, just drag the Octave.app icon to the Trash.  If you're new to Octave then you may have a look at the documents that come with your Octave. These <span class="file">*.pdf</span> files are installed in the docs folder of your <span class="file">octave.dmg</span> file.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Limitations</h2>

<p>There are currently some known limitations when using Octave.app. These limitations need not to be reported on an Octave mailing list. But if you find other bugs or other limitations in the Octave.app respectively Octave then please report them to <a href="mailto:bug-octave@octave.org">bug-octave@octave.org</a>.

     <ul>
<li><b>Fortran90 code files cannot be compiled.</b> <br>
Fortran90 and Fortran95 code files etc. cannot be compiled when using the command <span class="command">mkoctfile</span> on the command line or when using the commands <span class="command">mkoctfile</span> or <span class="command">mex</span> in Octave. The reason is that the program <span class="command">f2c</span> has been set up in Octave.app that can just convert Fortran77 code files into C&ndash;files. The C&ndash;files are then compiled with the command <span class="command">gcc</span> that comes with your Apple's XCode Tools (Install these from 'DVD 1 of your Mac OS X Install Discs'). The <span class="command">f2c</span> program is one of the smallest and oldest free Fortran converters/compilers available. Setting up another Fortran compiler that can compile Fortran90 and Fortran95 code files (eg. <span class="command">gfortran</span>) for all the different versions of Apple's XCode Tools and <span class="command">gcc</span> versions is too difficult. We hope that <span class="command">gfortran</span> will become part of Apple's XCode Tools so that we do not need to set up <span class="command">f2c</span> anymore. <br> <br>

<li><b>Some packages from Octave&ndash;Forge's website cannot be installed.</b> <br>
Some of Octave&ndash;Forge's packages cannot be installed because of the reason of a missing <span class="command">gfortran</span> command described before. Known packages that cannot be installed because they come with Fortran90 code files are
          <ul>
<li>optiminterp
</ul>
     If you want to find out more information why the installation of a specific package fails use the command <span class="command">pkg -v &lt;package.tar.gz&gt;</span> that runs the <span class="command">pkg</span> command in verbose mode. <br> <br>

<li><b>No spaces in the pathname before octave.app.</b> <br>
Do not install Octave.app in a place of your filesystem including spaces in the pathname before Octave.app. Valid destinations eg. are <span class="file">/Application/Octave.app</span> or <span class="file">/Users/Me/Desktop/Octave.app</span>. Not valid destinations including spaces in the pathname eg. are <span class="file">/Applications/Other Apps/Desktop/Octave.app</span> and <span class="file">/Users/My Home/Desktop/Octave.app</span>. If you set up Octave.app with a not valid pathname then this might result in different errors at startup or when running the Octave application that cannot be reproduced.

<h2 class="chapter">5 FAQs</h2>

<p>
     <ul>
<li><b>Is there a 64&ndash;bit version of Octave.app available?</b> <br>
There is no 64&ndash;bit version of Octave.app available. If you'd like to install a 64&ndash;bit version of Octave then you need to set up one for your own. A good starting point for creating such a binary would be <a href="http://wiki.octave.org/wiki.pl?OctaveForMac">http://wiki.octave.org/wiki.pl?OctaveForMac</a>.  Please consider contributing regular builds to octave-forge. <br> <br>

<li><b>How can I startup Octave.app?</b> <br>
After Octave.app has been placed to your desktop or to your applications folder or anywhere else in your filesystem tree you can double&ndash;click the Octave.app icon. This opens a new Terminal.app window and starts Octave in this new Terminal.app. Another way to open the Octave.app is to use the command <span class="command">open</span> on the command line. If you installed Octave.app in your applications folder then a one time startup might look like eg.
     <pre class="example">          bash ~$ open /Applications/Octave.app
     </pre>
     <p>
<li><b>How can I startup Octave.app with a XTerm window?</b> <br>
If you prefer using the application <span class="command">xterm</span> instead of the Terminal.app that comes with your X11 runtime environment (Install from 'DVD 1 of your Mac OS X Install Discs') then you can set up the environment variable <var>OCTAVE_TERMINAL=X11</var> before starting the Octave.app. A description about how to set up environment variables for all processes launched by a specific user can be found at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html">http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html</a>. If you installed Octave.app in your applications folder then a one time startup might look like eg.
     <pre class="example">          bash ~$ export OCTAVE_TERMINAL=X11
          bash ~$ open /Applications/Octave.app
     </pre>
     <p>
<li><b>How can I startup Octave in a Terminal.app or an XTerm that is already running?</b> <br>
A modified startup script has been placed into the Octave.app that can be used to startup Octave in an already running Terminal.app or a <span class="command">xterm</span> application. The place of this startup script is <code>&lt;octave.app&gt;/Contents/Resources/bin/octave</code>. If you have installed Octave.app in your applications folder then a startup in your already running Terminal.app or XTerm application might look like eg.
     <pre class="example">          bash ~$ /Applications/Octave.app/Contents/Resources/bin/octave
     </pre>
     <p>Another way to use Octave from the command line is to set up a link to the Octave startup script of Octave.app that is placed somewhere in your system's <var>PATH</var>. If you have installed Octave.app in your applications folder then setting up a link and starting up Octave might look like eg.
     <pre class="example">          bash ~$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/octave /Applications/Octave.app/Contents/Resources/bin/octave
          bash ~$ octave
     </pre>
     <p>
<li><b>How can I use mkoctfile in a Terminal.app or a XTerm that is already running?</b> <br>
A modified startup script has been placed into the Octave.app that can be used to run mkoctfile in an already running Terminal.app or a <span class="command">xterm</span> application. The place of this startup script is <code>&lt;octave.app&gt;/Contents/Resources/bin/mkoctfile</code>. If you have installed Octave.app in your applications folder then the use of the command <span class="command">mkoctfile</span> might look like eg.
     <pre class="example">          bash ~$ /Applications/Octave.app/Contents/Resources/bin/mkoctfile &lt;file.cc&gt;
     </pre>
     <p>Another way to use the command <span class="command">mkoctfile</span> from the command line is to set up a link to the <span class="command">mkoctfile</span> startup script of Octave.app that is placed somewhere in your system's <var>PATH</var>. If you have installed Octave.app in your applications folder then setting up a link and starting up Octave might look like eg.
     <pre class="example">          bash ~$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/mkoctfile /Applications/Octave.app/Contents/Resources/bin/mkoctfile
          bash ~$ mkoctfile &lt;file.cc&gt;
     </pre>
