@deftypefn {Function File} {} __zgpbal__ (@var{sys})

Used internally in @command{tzero}; minimal argument checking performed.

Implementation of zero computation generalized eigenvalue problem
balancing method (Hodel and Tiller, Allerton Conference, 1991)
Based on Ward's balancing algorithm (@acronym{SIAM} J. Sci Stat. Comput., 1981).

@command{__zgpbal__} computes a state/input/output weighting that attempts to
reduced the range of the magnitudes of the nonzero elements of [@var{a}, @var{b},
@var{c}, @var{d}].
The weighting uses scalar multiplication by powers of 2, so no roundoff
will occur.

@command{__zgpbal__} should be followed by @command{zgpred}.
