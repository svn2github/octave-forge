@deftypefn {Function File} {} rank (@var{a}, @var{tol})
Compute the rank of @var{a}, using the singular value decomposition.
The rank is taken to be the number  of singular values of @var{a} that
are greater than the specified tolerance @var{tol}.  If the second
argument is omitted, it is taken to be

@example
tol = max (size (@var{a})) * sigma(1) * eps;
@end example

@noindent
where @code{eps} is machine precision and @code{sigma(1)} is the largest
singular value of @var{a}.
@end deftypefn
