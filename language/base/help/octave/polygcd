@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{q} =} polygcd (@var{b}, @var{a}, @var{tol})

Find greatest common divisor of two polynomials.  This is equivalent
to the polynomial found by multiplying together all the common roots.
Together with deconv, you can reduce a ratio of two polynomials.
Tolerance defaults to 
@example 
sqrt(eps).
@end example
 Note that this is an unstable
algorithm, so don't try it on large polynomials.

Example
@example
polygcd (poly(1:8), poly(3:12)) - poly(3:8)
@result{} [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
deconv (poly(1:8), polygcd (poly(1:8), poly(3:12))) ...
  - poly(1:2)
@result{} [ 0, 0, 0 ]
