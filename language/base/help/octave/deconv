@deftypefn {Function File} {} deconv (@var{y}, @var{a})
Deconvolve two vectors.

@code{[b, r] = deconv (y, a)} solves for @var{b} and @var{r} such that
@code{y = conv (a, b) + r}.

If @var{y} and @var{a} are polynomial coefficient vectors, @var{b} will
contain the coefficients of the polynomial quotient and @var{r} will be
a remainder polynomial of lowest order.
