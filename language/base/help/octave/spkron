@deftypefn {Function File} {} spkron (@var{a}, @var{b})
Form the kronecker product of two sparse matrices. This is defined
block by block as

@example
x = [a(i, j) b]
@end example

For example,

@example
@group
kron(speye(3),spdiag([1,2,3]))
@result{}
Compressed Column Sparse (rows = 9, cols = 9, nnz = 9)

  (2, 2) ->  2
  (3, 3) ->  3
  (4, 4) ->  1
  (5, 5) ->  2
  (6, 6) ->  3
  (7, 7) ->  1
  (8, 8) ->  2
  (9, 9) ->  3
