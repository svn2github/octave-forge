This package has been built against the @OCTAVE_VERSION@ version of Octave. This
version has many new features relative to previous versions, including

* integer types
* fixed point arithmetic
* sparse matrices
* Linear programming code based on GLPK
* 64-bit compilation support
* gzipped files and stream and consequently support of Matlab v7 files
* Matlab compatiable graphic handles
* better support for both msvc and mingw
* fully compatiable MEX interface
* many many other minor features and compatibility changes

Using this package for the development of OCT and MEX files:
-----------------------------------------------------------

To build OCT or MEX files from their sources requires that a compiler
is installed. Ideally this should be the same compiler version as has
been used to compile this package. This version of Octave has been
compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0, which is available for free
download from

http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

Visual C++ can not be distributed with Octave due to licensing
restrictions on redistribution. Once Visual C++ is installed, then
OCT files can be compiled from the Octave prompt with the "mkoctfile"
command, whereas as MEX files can be compiled with the "mex" command.

Contributing to Octave:
----------------------

There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make Octave
a better system. Perhaps the most important way to contribute is to
write high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make your
code freely available for others to use. For inspiration, we have a
wish-list of projects (http://www.octave.org/projects.html) and
feature requests.

If you've written a useful function for Octave that you would like to
make available for others to use, please post it to the sources
mailing list (sources@octave.org). Messages sent to this list will be
seen by the Octave maintainers, and will be considered for inclusion
in future releases of Octave. The messages are also archived
(http://www.octave.org/archive.org) , so even if the code is not
included in a future release, it will remain available for others to
use.

If you find Octave useful, consider providing additional funding
(http://www.octave.org/funding.html) to continue its development. Even
a modest amount of additional funding could make a significant
difference in the amount of time that its author can devote to
development and support.

If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still help
make Octave better and more reliable by reporting any bugs
(http://www.octave.org/bugs.html) you find and by offering suggestions
for ways to improve Octave.
