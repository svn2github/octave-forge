@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{mag}, @var{phase}, @var{w}] =} nichols (@var{sys}, @var{w}, @var{outputs}, @var{inputs})
Produce Nichols plot of a system.

@strong{Inputs}
@table @var
@item sys
System data structure (must be either purely continuous or discrete; 
see @command{is_digital}).
@item w
Frequency values for evaluation.
@itemize
@item if sys is continuous, then nichols evaluates @math{G(jw)}.
@item if sys is discrete, then nichols evaluates @math{G(exp(jwT))}, 
where @var{T}=@var{sys}. @var{tsam} is the system sampling time.
@item the default frequency range is selected as follows (These
       steps are @strong{not} performed if @var{w} is specified):
@enumerate
@item via routine @command{__bodquist__}, isolate all poles and zeros away from
@var{w}=0 (@math{jw=0} or @math{exp(jwT)=1}) and select the frequency range 
based on the breakpoint locations of the frequencies.
@item if sys is discrete time, the frequency range is limited to jwT in 
@iftex
@tex
$ [0, 2p\pi] $.
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
[0,2p*pi].
@end ifinfo
@item A ``smoothing'' routine is used to ensure that the plot phase does
not change excessively from point to point and that singular points 
(e.g., crossovers from +/- 180) are accurately shown.
@end enumerate
@end itemize
@item outputs
@itemx inputs
the names or indices of the output(s) and input(s) to be used in the 
frequency response; see @command{sysprune}.
@end table
@strong{Outputs}
@table @var
@item mag
@itemx phase
The magnitude and phase of the frequency response @math{G(jw)} or 
@math{G(exp(jwT))} at the selected frequency values.
@item w
The vector of frequency values used.
@end table
If no output arguments are given, @command{nichols} plots the results to the screen.
Descriptive labels are automatically placed. See @command{xlabel}, 
@command{ylabel}, and @command{title}.

Note: if the requested plot is for an @acronym{MIMO} system, @var{mag} is set to
@iftex
@tex
$ \Vert G(jw) \Vert $ or $ \Vert G( {\rm exp}(jwT) \Vert $
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
||G(jw)|| or ||G(exp(jwT))||
@end ifinfo
and phase information is not computed.
