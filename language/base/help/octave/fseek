@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} fseek (@var{fid}, @var{offset}, @var{origin})
Set the file pointer to any location within the file @var{fid}.

The pointer is positioned @var{offset} characters from the @var{origin},
which may be one of the predefined variables @code{SEEK_CUR} (current
position), @code{SEEK_SET} (beginning), or @code{SEEK_END} (end of
file) or strings "cof", "bof" or "eof". If @var{origin} is omitted,
@code{SEEK_SET} is assumed.  The offset must be zero, or a value returned
by @code{ftell} (in which case @var{origin} must be @code{SEEK_SET}).

Return 0 on success and -1 on error.
