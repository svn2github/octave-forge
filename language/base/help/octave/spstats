@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{count}, @var{mean}, @var{var}] =} spstats (@var{s})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{count}, @var{mean}, @var{var}] =} spstats (@var{s}, @var{j})
Return the stats for the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix @var{s}.
@var{count} is the number of non-zeros in each column, @var{mean}
is the mean of the non-zeros in each column, and @var{var} is the  
variance of the non-zeros in each column.

Called with two input arguments, if @var{s} is the data and @var{j}
is the bin number for the data, compute the stats for each bin.  In 
this case, bins can contain data values of zero, whereas with 
@code{spstats (@var{s})} the zeros may disappear.
