@defvr {Built-in Variable} LOADPATH
A colon separated list of directories in which to search for function
files.  @xref{Functions and Scripts}.  The value of @code{LOADPATH}
overrides the environment variable @code{OCTAVE_PATH}.  @xref{Installation}.

@code{LOADPATH} is now handled in the same way as @TeX{} handles
@code{TEXINPUTS}.  Leading, trailing, or doubled colons that appear in
@code{LOADPATH} are replaced by the value of @code{DEFAULT_LOADPATH}.
The default value of @code{LOADPATH} is @code{"
:"}, which tells Octave to search in the directories specified by
@code{DEFAULT_LOADPATH}.

In addition, if any path element ends in @samp{//}, that directory and
all subdirectories it contains are searched recursively for function
files.  This can result in a slight delay as Octave caches the lists of
files found in the @code{LOADPATH} the first time Octave searches for a
function.  After that, searching is usually much faster because Octave
normally only needs to search its internal cache for files.

To improve performance of recursive directory searching, it is best for
each directory that is to be searched recursively to contain
@emph{either} additional subdirectories @emph{or} function files, but
not a mixture of both.

@xref{Organization of Functions}, for a description of the function file
directories that are distributed with Octave.
