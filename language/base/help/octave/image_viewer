@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{fcn}, @var{default_zoom}] =} image_viewer (@var{fcn}, @var{default_zoom})
Change the program or function used for viewing images and return the
previous values.

When the @code{image} or @code{imshow} function is called it will
launch an external program to display the image.  The default behaviour
is to use gnuplot if the installed version supports image viewing,
and otherwise try the programs @code{display}, @code{xv}, and
@code{xloadimage}.  Using this function it is possible to change that
behaviour.

When called with one input argument images will be displayed by saving
the image to a file and the system command @var{command} will called
to view the image.  The @var{command} must be a string containing
@code{%s} and possibly @code{%f}. The @code{%s} will be replaced by
the filename of the image, and the @code{%f} will (if present) be
replaced by the zoom factor given to the @code{image} function.
For example,
@example
image_viewer ("eog %s");
@end example
changes the image viewer to the @code{eog} program.

With two input arguments, images will be displayed by calling
the function @var{function_handle}.  For example,
@example
image_viewer (data, @@my_image_viewer);
@end example
sets the image viewer function to @code{my_image_viewer}.  The image
viewer function is called with
@example
my_image_viewer (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{im}, @var{zoom}, @var{data})
@end example
where @var{x} and @var{y} are the axis of the image, @var{im} is the image
variable, and @var{data} is extra user-supplied data to be passed to
the viewer function.

With three input arguments it is possible to change the zooming.
Some programs (like @code{xloadimage}) require the zoom factor to be
between 0 and 100, and not 0 and 1 like Octave assumes. This is
solved by setting the third argument to 100.
