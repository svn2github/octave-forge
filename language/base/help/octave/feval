@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} feval (@var{name}, @dots{})
Evaluate the function named @var{name}.  Any arguments after the first
are passed on to the named function.  For example,

@example
feval ("acos", -1)
     @result{} 3.1416
@end example

@noindent
calls the function @code{acos} with the argument @samp{-1}.

The function @code{feval} is necessary in order to be able to write
functions that call user-supplied functions, because Octave does not
have a way to declare a pointer to a function (like C) or to declare a
special kind of variable that can be used to hold the name of a function
(like @code{EXTERNAL} in Fortran).  Instead, you must refer to functions
by name, and use @code{feval} to call them.
