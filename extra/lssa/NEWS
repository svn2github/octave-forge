Welcome to the first release of lssa, 0.1.0

Current status:
 
 ** lscomplex and lsreal both produce accurate results; they can be slow for
    very large datasets.

 ** fastlscomplex is accurate for the first octave of results; there is still an
    error I need to pin down in the merging for additional octaves. fastlsreal
    is disabled at the moment as I move to an implementation based on the new
    fastlscomplex.

 ** lscorrcoeff works, although I'm still attempting to understand the initial
    author's reasoning. Its generated results are relevant to any given data
    set, but it does not appear to be normalized to any great extent.

 ** lsrealwavelet and lscomplexwavelet are not currently correct or even really
    functional; this is an ongoing struggle for me, and if anyone can suggest
    what I might do to improve them, please! By all means, send me an email.
