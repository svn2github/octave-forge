@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{f}, @var{w}, @var{rsys}] =} __bodquist__ (@var{sys}, @var{w}, @var{out_idx}, @var{in_idx})
Used internally by @command{bode}, @command{nyquist}; compute system frequency response.

@strong{Inputs}
@table @var
@item sys
input system structure
@item w
range of frequencies; empty if user wants default
@item out_idx
@itemx in_idx
names or indices of output/input signal names; empty if user wants all
@item rname
name of routine that called __bodquist__ ("bode", "nyquist", or "nichols")
@end table
@strong{Outputs}
@table @var
@item w
list of frequencies
@item f
frequency response of sys; @math{f(ii) = f(omega(ii))}
@item rsys
system with selected inputs and outputs
@end table

@code{bode}, @code{nichols}, and @code{nyquist} share the same 
introduction, so the common parts are
in __bodquist__.  It contains the part that finds the number of arguments,
determines whether or not the system is @acronym{SISO}, and computes the frequency
response.  Only the way the response is plotted is different between the
these functions.
