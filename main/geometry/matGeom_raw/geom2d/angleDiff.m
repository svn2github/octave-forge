function dif = angleDiff(angle1, angle2)
%ANGLEDIFF Difference between two angles
%
%   Computes the signed angular difference between two angles in radians.
%   The result is comprised between -PI and +PI.
%
%   Example
%     A = angleDiff(-pi/4, pi/4)
%     A = 
%         1.5708    % equal to pi/2
%     A = angleDiff(pi/4, -pi/4)
%     A = 
%        -1.5708    % equal to -pi/2
