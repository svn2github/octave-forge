@deffn {Command} history options
If invoked with no arguments, @code{history} displays a list of commands
that you have executed.  Valid options are:

@table @code
@item -w @var{file}
Write the current history to the file @var{file}.  If the name is
omitted, use the default history file (normally @file{~/.octave_hist}).

@item -r @var{file}
Read the file @var{file}, replacing the current history list with its
contents.  If the name is omitted, use the default history file
(normally @file{~/.octave_hist}).

@item @var{n}
Only display the most recent @var{n} lines of history.

@item -q
Don't number the displayed lines of history.  This is useful for cutting
and pasting commands if you are using the X Window System.
@end table

For example, to display the five most recent commands that you have
typed without displaying line numbers, use the command
@kbd{history -q 5}.
@end deffn
