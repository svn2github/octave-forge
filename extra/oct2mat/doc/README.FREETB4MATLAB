INTRODUCTION: 
==============
FreeTb4Matlab is a collection of free toolboxes from Octave for Matlab. 
The library has been automatically converted from octave and octave-forge functions using oct2mat.

This involves several limitations:
1) only m-files (but no mex and oct-files) are supported. 
2) No testing has been performed. Therefore, it is likely, that some functions will not 
(or not properly) work with matlab. This problem will become smaller as more and more 
users (like You) are using it.

There will be no perfect solution, because independent changes and development can 
not be completely avoid. Nevertheless, the aim of FreeTb4OctMat is twofold
(1) more open source toolboxes available to matlab users. 
(2) matlab users will get involved in testing and improving 
FreeTb4OctMat and the original sources.

And especially Paul Kienzle for oct2mat

INSTALL: 
==========

You need awk (available on any unix system).
Binaries for win32 are available from here:
  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm
  http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/

1) Include path to oct2mat
        addpath $HOME/octave-forge/extra/oct2mat/inst
2) convert Octave/scripts
        freetb4matlab  $HOME/octave/scripts /tmp/freetb
3) convert Octave-forge        
        freetb4matlab  $HOME/octave-forge /tmp/freetb



CONTACT: 
==========

Mailing list of Octave-Forge: <octave-dev@lists.sf.net>. 

Or You can contact the orginal authors of the functions, but keep in mind that many 
authors were writing the functions for Octave, only. In such a case, a bug is only a bug 
if it is not working with Octave.
