@chapheading Preface
The @acronym{GNU} Octave control package from version 2 onwards was
developed by Lukas F. Reichlin and is based on the proven open-source
library @acronym{SLICOT}. This new package is intended as a replacement
for control-1.0.11 by A. Scottedward Hodel and his students.
Its main features are:
@itemize
@item Reliable solvers for Lyapunov, Sylvester and algebraic Riccati equations.
@item Pole placement techniques as well as @tex $ H_2 $ @end tex
and @tex $ H_{\infty} $ @end tex
synthesis methods.
@item Frequency-weighted model and controller reduction.
@item Overloaded operators due to the use of classes introduced with Octave 3.2.
@item Support for descriptor state-space models and non-proper transfer functions.
@item Improved @acronym{MATLAB} compatibility.

@subheading Acknowledgments
The author is indebted to several people and institutions who helped
him to achieve his goals. I am particularly grateful to Luca Favatella
who introduced me to Octave development as well as discussed and revised
my early draft code with great patience. My continued support from the
@acronym{FHNW} University of Applied Sciences of Northwestern Switzerland,
where I could work on the control package as a semester project, has also
been important. Furthermore, I thank the @acronym{SLICOT} authors
Peter Benner, Vasile Sima and Andras Varga for their advice.

@subheading Using the help function
Some functions of the control package are listed with a leading @code{@@lti/}.
This is only needed to view the help text of the function, e.g. @w{@code{help norm}}
shows the built-in function while @w{@code{help @@lti/norm}} shows the overloaded
function for @acronym{LTI} systems. Note that there are @acronym{LTI} functions
like @code{pole} that have no built-in equivalent.

When just using the function, the leading @code{@@lti/} must @strong{not} be typed.
Octave selects the right function automatically. So one can type @w{@code{norm (sys, inf)}}
and @w{@code{norm (matrix, inf)}} regardless of the class of the argument.
