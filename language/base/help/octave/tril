@deftypefn {Function File} {} tril (@var{a}, @var{k})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} triu (@var{a}, @var{k})
Return a new matrix formed by extracting the lower (@code{tril})
or upper (@code{triu}) triangular part of the matrix @var{a}, and
setting all other elements to zero.  The second argument is optional,
and specifies how many diagonals above or below the main diagonal should
also be set to zero.

The default value of @var{k} is zero, so that @code{triu} and
@code{tril} normally include the main diagonal as part of the result
matrix.

If the value of @var{k} is negative, additional elements above (for
@code{tril}) or below (for @code{triu}) the main diagonal are also
selected.

The absolute value of @var{k} must not be greater than the number of
sub- or super-diagonals.

For example,

@example
@group
tril (ones (3), -1)
@result{}  0  0  0
         1  0  0
         1  1  0
@end group
@end example

@noindent
and

@example
@group
tril (ones (3), 1)
@result{}  1  1  0
         1  1  1
         1  1  1
@end group
