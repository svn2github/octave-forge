Query or set the secondary prompt string.  The secondary prompt is
printed when Octave is expecting additional input to complete a
command.  For example, if you are typing a for loop that spans several
lines, Octave will print the secondary prompt at the beginning of
each line after the first.  The default value of the secondary prompt
string is @code{"> "}.
