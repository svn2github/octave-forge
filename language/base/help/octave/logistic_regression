@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{theta}, @var{beta}, @var{dev}, @var{dl}, @var{d2l}, @var{p}] =} logistic_regression (@var{y}, @var{x}, @var{print}, @var{theta}, @var{beta})
Perform ordinal logistic regression.

Suppose @var{y} takes values in @var{k} ordered categories, and let
@code{gamma_i (@var{x})} be the cumulative probability that @var{y}
falls in one of the first @var{i} categories given the covariate
@var{x}.  Then

@example
[theta, beta] = logistic_regression (y, x)
@end example

@noindent
fits the model

@example
logit (gamma_i (x)) = theta_i - beta' * x,   i = 1...k-1
@end example

The number of ordinal categories, @var{k}, is taken to be the number
of distinct values of @code{round (@var{y})}.  If @var{k} equals 2,
@var{y} is binary and the model is ordinary logistic regression.  The
matrix @var{x} is assumed to have full column rank.

Given @var{y} only, @code{theta = logistic_regression (y)}
fits the model with baseline logit odds only.

The full form is

@example
[theta, beta, dev, dl, d2l, gamma]
   = logistic_regression (y, x, print, theta, beta)
@end example

@noindent
in which all output arguments and all input arguments except @var{y}
are optional.

Setting @var{print} to 1 requests summary information about the fitted
model to be displayed.  Setting @var{print} to 2 requests information
about convergence at each iteration.  Other values request no
information to be displayed.  The input arguments @var{theta} and
@var{beta} give initial estimates for @var{theta} and @var{beta}.

The returned value @var{dev} holds minus twice the log-likelihood.

The returned values @var{dl} and @var{d2l} are the vector of first
and the matrix of second derivatives of the log-likelihood with
respect to @var{theta} and @var{beta}.

@var{p} holds estimates for the conditional distribution of @var{y}
given @var{x}.
