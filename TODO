When transitioning to Octave 3.1
================================
* Remove the functions gtext, ginput, waitforbuttonpress, hex2num, num2hex, 
  dlmread, dlmwrite, csvread, csvwrite
* Remove dependency of ga on miscellaneous

Packages
========
* GPC package needs conversion to package manager

* Fix the "make -C packages compare" target so that it correctly
  identifies packages that need updating on sourceforge

* gsl_sf.cc is a derived file, but the function reference links to
  rather than the template, consider a better means of addressing this.

Bugs
====
* ausave -> auload changes the data

Admin
=====

* Include support for more tests in the makefile.

* Maintain global TODO document by automatically extracting ## TODO:
comments from all of the scripts.  Update all functions to include
compatibility notes (aka missing features) in these comments.  Some
function specific notes in matcompat/compat.dat belong in TODO comments.

* nonfree/gpc uses its own configure script and build process

All functions
=============

* Use texinfo in the function descriptions.

* Add test and demo scripts for each function.  Should we use
extra/testfun, or should we use name_test.m and name_demo.m?
	
* Replace x(find(cond)) with x(cond) since it is faster and cleaner.
Remove unwind_protect blocks for do_fortran_indexing, since most
instances will be covered by this.

* Replace max(max(x)) with max(x(:)), and so on for min, sum, etc.

Specific functions
==================

* Use newer version of QHull.

* Give ginput a "number of inputs" parameter.  Redefine gtext as an
m-file which calls ginput(1) to get the text location.

* Give ginput a rubber-banding facility, maybe with number of inputs =
-1 ?  Redefine gzoom as an m-file which calls ginput(-1) to get the
region.

* Have ginput return the key/mouse button used to exit.
