This is a binary release of Octave 3.2.3 for Windows platform using 
mingw32/gcc build tools. It has been tested on Windows 2K and XP.

Octave-3.2.3_i686-pc-mingw32_gcc-4.4.0_setup.exe

This package contains Octave 3.2.3 and a set of octave-forge packages.
Some packages are missing because external dependency libraries have not 
been built using mingw32/gcc yet.

This package includes notepad++ as text editor and gnuplot as graphical 
engine. It is bundled with the version of GCC used to compile this package 
and a MSYS environment to install octave-forge packages.

This package has been built using GCC-4.4.0 from http://www.mingw.org

The installer can be installed side-by-side with previous versions of
octave/mingw32 and thus does not uninstall any previously installed version 
of octave/mingw32.


Changes since Octave/mingw32 3.2.2:
-----------------------------------

*) Build with gcc-4.4.0 from http://www.mingw.org
*) Update to gnuplot 4.3.0-2009-07-08 CVS snapshot
*) for gnuplot, add a workaround patch to SF#2848002
*) build gnuplot with support for wxwidgets terminal. To use it, set the
   environment variable GNUTERM to "wxt", e.g. from within octave execute
      putenv("GNUTERM","wxt")
*) Build Graphicsmagick as relocatable dll and remove dependency on 
   environment variable defining installation location
*) Update several dependency libraries
*) Add SSE/SSE2-enabled fftw3 library
*) add the fixed-0.7.10 octave forge package to installer

Fixed Issues in 3.2.3:
----------------------

*) Printing to pdf no longer yields spurious empty pages using gnuplot
*) Pressing CTRL-C within octave should no longer crash gnuplot
*) the command "clear all" no longer segfaults after calling eigs()

Known Issues with octave/mingw32 3.2.3:
--------------------------------------

*) The command "clear all" results in a segfault.
   This is currently triggered by the following octave-forge packages:
      windows
      octcdf
      communications
      ga (depends on communications)
      
   The error occurs only if any of these packages is marked "-auto" 
   i.e. is loaded at startup.
   
*) Installing octave respectively running octave from a path which contains
   spaces breaks the installation of octave-forge packages using octave's
   package manager pkg.m.
   It this therefore highly recommended to install octave to a path WITHOUT
   spaces. Octave will work if installed to a path including spaces, and all 
   packages added at the installation will work if installed into a path 
   containing spaces, HOWEVER you will currently NOT be able to install 
   packages using octave's package manager at a later time if Octave was 
   installed to a directory containing spaces.

*) "make check" results:

   Summary:
   
    PASS   5754
    FAIL      3
   
   octave-3.2.3\src\data.cc  PASS  506/509  FAIL 3
