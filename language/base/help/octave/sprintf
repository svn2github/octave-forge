@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} sprintf (@var{template}, @dots{})
This is like @code{printf}, except that the output is returned as a
string.  Unlike the C library function, which requires you to provide a
suitably sized string as an argument, Octave's @code{sprintf} function
returns the string, automatically sized to hold all of the items
converted.
