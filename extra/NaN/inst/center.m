function [i,S] = center(i,DIM)
% CENTER removes the mean 
%
% [z,mu] = center(x,DIM)
%   removes mean x along dimension DIM
%
% DIM	dimension
%	1: column
%	2: row
%	default or []: first DIMENSION, with more than 1 element
%
% features:
% - can deal with NaN's (missing values)
% - dimension argument 
% - compatible to Matlab and Octave
