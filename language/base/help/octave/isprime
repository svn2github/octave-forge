@deftypefn {Function File} {} isprime (@var{n})

Return true if @var{n} is a prime number, false otherwise.

Something like the following is much faster if you need to test a lot
of small numbers:

@example
@var{t} = ismember (@var{n}, primes (max (@var{n} (:))));
@end example

If max(n) is very large, then you should be using special purpose 
factorization code.

@end deftypefn
